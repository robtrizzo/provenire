# Backgrounds

Day in and day out. Generation after generation. The price of living in the Steel Trap is labor. The overseers demand harsh quotas and dole out harsh punishments at their whims. The workers of the Steel Trap toil on and withstand the humiliations and cruelties of their overseers. Their families depend on the meager scraps they bring home.

Your Background is the job your character labors in the factory. It grants them unique character questions, actions, contacts, and dangers to overcome in pursuit of food.

### Subsistence

Not everyone who lives in the factory works. Many are too young, too old, or not cut out for the brutality of the factory floor. These people rely on the labor of their family members to survive. Your character works not only to feed themselves, but to feed their loved ones as well.

During the Churn, there is a **Subsistence** phase. First, each character rolls **fortune** and increases the **Starvation** clock by the result: **1-3:** three, **4/5:** two, **6:** one. If the **Starvation** clock fills, one of the character's family members perishes from hunger.

After the **Starvation** clock has been advanced, the PC labors in the dangerous conditions dictated by their Background. They roll an action that must include one granted by their Background to determine results. You may choose to spend 1 **food** to reduce the **Starvation** clock by 1 during downtime.

- **Critical Success:** As success, but gain an additional benefit according to your Background.
- **Success:** You've earned enough to feed your family and yourself. Reduce the **Starvation** clock by 2.
- **Partial Success:** As success, but suffer consequences according to your Background.
- **Failure:** You've earned nothing. Mark a level one permanent harm: "hungry". This cannot be healed until you eat. Suffer consequences according to your Background.

<span className="text-red-500">Archivist</span><span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">Read manuals and catalog inventory</span>
</TypographyH2>

As the story goes, the Steel Trap's machinery was designed by a man inspired by divine dreams. Archivists are the few capable of reading the cryptic scrawlings he left behind. Despite the Archivist's best efforts, the notes are incomplete and what little there is, is often incomprehensible.

When Archivists aren't studying, they're made responsible for keeping track of the factory's inventory. Not that they're given any authority to do anything about discrepencies. They're just supposed to know. And when things go wrong, they're the ones who get punished.

*You've been having strange dreams about the factory's machinery. What do you see?*

*You've been noticing discrepancies in the factory's inventory. What's missing?*

### Mission

#### Actions

- **Assess (H):** Think before acting. Catalog the possible advantages and consequences of a course of action.
- **Study (M):** Research a topic or item. Gain insight into its function or history.

### The Churn

#### Contacts

- **[name]:** An expert in the scrawlings of the mad creator. Old, sick, and quite mad themselves.
- **[name]:** A worker who's been skimming off the top of the inventory. They're in over their head and need help covering their tracks.

#### Subsistence

**Critical Benefit:** Skim off the top of the inventory. Gain 1 **material**.

**Failure Consequence** (choose one):
 - The overseers have noticed discrepancies. They force you to stay up for days straight to correct the error. Suffer a temporary level 2 harm: "exhausted".
 - You hear [Creator's] Whispers in the machinery. Advance the **[Creator's] Madness** clock by 1.

<span className="text-red-500">Enforcer</span><span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">Keep the fear and enforce the rules</span>
</TypographyH2>

Not all overseers are beasts. They employ and coerce plenty of workers into doing their dirty work for them. Enforcers are the ones tasked with keeping the fear alive in the Steel Trap. They know their communities best and can use that knowledge to keep the workers in line.

Not all Enforcers do this willingly. Many have dogged Overseer "patrons" who keep them in line with threats of violence against their families. Others are just as cruel as the overseers themselves.

*Why do you do the overseers' bidding? What happened to you?*

*You know a flaw in the overseers' penal pen security. What is it?*

### Mission

#### Actions

- **Frighten (I):** Use fear as a blunt instrument
- **Observe (M):** Watch and learn. Gain insight into a person or situation.

### The Churn

#### Contacts

- **[name]:** An overseer who's willing to do favors in exchange for your help advancing their career.
- **[name]:** An enforcer who uses torture to get what they want.

#### Subsistence

**Critical Benefit:** You found an opportunity to pin blame on someone else. Name them and reduce the crew's Heat by 2.

**Failure Consequence** (choose one):
 - You're forced to give an ally a beating. The crew loses 1 **goodwill**.
 - You don't do the job the way the overseers want. Advance the **Threat to your family** clock by 1.

</TypographyH2>

The Steel Trap's machinery is always roaring, rattling, and shaking itself apart. Machinists are the ones who crawl into the belly of the matrix and keep it running.

The depths of the machines are unpredictable, shifting day to day. However, their ever-changing anatomy sometimes reveals secrets or treasures consumed by the factory long ago.

*You've found a hidden compartment in the machinery. What's inside?*

*A friend got lost in the matrix and you had to leave them behind. What happened?*

### Mission

- **Interface (H):** Work with the machinery to accomplish a task.
- **Squeeze (I):** Get into or out of a tight spot.

### The Churn

- **[name]** An experienced machinist who's a master contortionist.

#### Subsistence

**Failure Consequence** (choose one):
 - The shifting innards nearly trap you. Take 2 stress.
 - The machine's issues require you to squirm deeper and deeper. Advance the **Belly of the Beast** clock by 1.
