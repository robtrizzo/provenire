# Backgrounds

Day in and day out. Generation after generation. The price of living in the Steel Trap is labor. The overseers demand harsh quotas and dole out harsher punishments at their whims. The workers of the Steel Trap toil on and withstand the humiliations and cruelties of their overseers. Their families depend on the meager scraps they bring home.

Your Background is the job your character labors in the factory. It grants them unique character questions, actions, contacts, and dangers to overcome in the [Subsistence](/game/the-churn#subsistence) Phase.

  </span>
</TypographyH2>

As the story goes, the Steel Trap's machinery was designed by a man inspired by divine dreams. Archivists are the few capable of reading, so are tasked with interpreting the cryptic scrawlings he left behind. Despite the Archivist's best efforts, the notes are incomplete and what little there is, is often incomprehensible.

When Archivists aren't studying, they're made responsible for keeping track of the factory's inventory. Not that they're given any authority to do anything about discrepencies. They're just supposed to know. And when things go wrong, they're the ones who get punished.

_You've been having strange dreams about the factory's machinery. What do you see?_

_You've been noticing discrepancies in the factory's inventory. What's missing?_

### Mission

#### Actions

- **Assess <Flame className="inline-block mb-3" />:** Think before acting. Catalog the possible advantages and consequences of a course of action.
- **Study <VenetianMask className="inline-block mb-1" />:** Research a topic or item. Gain insight into its function or history.

### The Churn

#### Contacts

- **[name]:** An expert in the scrawlings of the mad creator. Old, sick, and quite mad themselves.
- **[name]:** A worker who's been skimming off the top of the inventory. They're in over their head and need help covering their tracks.

#### Subsistence

**Critical Benefit:** Skim off the top of the inventory. Gain 1 **material**.

**Failure Consequence** (choose one):

- The overseers have noticed discrepancies. They force you to stay up for days straight to correct the error. Suffer a temporary level 2 harm: "exhausted".
- You hear [Creator's] Whispers in the machinery. Advance the **[Creator's] Madness** clock by 1.

<TypographyH2 id="enforcer">
  <span className="text-red-500">Enforcer</span>
  <span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">
    Keep the fear and enforce the rules
  </span>
</TypographyH2>

Not all overseers are beasts. They employ and coerce plenty of workers into doing their dirty work for them. Enforcers are the ones tasked with keeping the fear alive in the Steel Trap. They know their communities best and can use that knowledge to keep the workers in line.

Not all Enforcers do this willingly. Many have dogged Overseer "patrons" who keep them in line with threats of violence against their families. Others are just as cruel as the overseers themselves.

_Why do you do the overseers' bidding? What happened to you?_

_You know a flaw in the overseers' penal pen security. What is it?_

  <span className="text-red-500">Machinist</span>
  <span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">
    Living replacement for broken parts
  </span>
</TypographyH2>

The Steel Trap's machinery is always roaring, rattling, and shaking itself apart. Machinists are the ones who crawl into the belly of the matrix and keep it running.

The depths of the machines are unpredictable, shifting day to day. However, their ever-changing anatomy sometimes reveals secrets or treasures consumed by the factory long ago.

_You've found a hidden compartment in the machinery. What's inside?_

_A friend got lost in the matrix and you had to leave them behind. What happened?_

### Mission

<TypographyH2 id="operator">
  <span className="text-red-500">Operator</span>
  <span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">
    Pull levers and crank wheels
  </span>
</TypographyH2>

The Steel Trap's blast doors and heavy machinery require constant manpower to keep running. Workers are expected to work their bodies ceaselessly to keep the hammers beating. Some don't survive the physical toll. Others are driven mad by the monotony.

Operators are the ones who meet the physical demand and train their minds to endure the repetition. The levers and wheels are a crucible that slowly reinforces their bodies and minds.

_What form of medidation have you learned to stave off the boredom?_

_A fellow worker hasn't been meeting quotas and you're not strong enough to cover for them. Who are they?_

### Mission

#### Actions

- **Pull <Activity className="inline-block mb-4" />:** Move something heavy or difficult.

### The Churn

#### Contacts

  <span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">
    Carry messages and transport crates
  </span>
</TypographyH2>

The Steel Trap is a labyrinth of corridors, catwalks, and machinery. Runners are the ones who navigate the maze to deliver messages and goods. Their memories have to be sharp and their legs strong to keep up with the demands of the factory.

Runners learn the factory floor like the back of their hand. They know the best routes to avoid the overseers and the best places to hide when things go wrong. In their day to day work, they overhear the goings-on of workers and overseers alike.

_Two overseers are plotting against each other. What are they planning?_

_An overseer took a shipment from you and framed you for it. What was in the shipment?_

### Mission

#### Subsistence

**Critical Benefit:** You've overhear the overseers planning. Gain 1 **intel**.

**Failure Consequence** (choose one):

- You get cornered by an overseer and forced to talk. The crew loses 1 **intel**.
- You deliver another shipment to a seemingly secret project. Advance the **Dreadful Cargo** clock by 1.

  <span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">
    Sort broken parts and salvage scrap
  </span>
</TypographyH2>

Broken parts and defective products are a fact of life in the Steel Trap. Each one tells a story about the machines that made them and the workers who were blamed for the failure. But materials aren't infinite. Workers are expected to sort through the refuse to fix the machines and enrich the overseers.

Scrappers are the ones coordinated enough to move through the dangerous piles of machinery innards and imaginative enough to see the potential of blasted pieces.

_You've found a nearly functional weapon meant for Fenrir's soldiers. What is it?_

_All your life you've heard whispered stories about the curse of the scrapyard. What have you experienced that makes you think they're right?_

### Mission

#### Actions

- **Step <Activity className="inline-block mb-4" />:** Move carefully through dangerous terrain.
- **Rummage <VenetianMask className="inline-block mb-1" />:** Search through refuse for something useful.

### The Churn

#### Contacts

- **[name]:** A scrapper who's been hoarding useless scrap for years.
- **[name]:** An overseer with a penchant for collecting rare and dangerous materials.

#### Subsistence

**Critical Benefit:** You've found a workable piece of scrap. Gain 1 **material**.

**Failure Consequence** (choose one):

  <span className="text-red-500">Stoker</span>
  <span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">
    Shovel coal and stoke the fires
  </span>
</TypographyH2>

The Steel Trap's machines are powered by monstrous furnaces that must burn day and night. These furnace rooms are clouded with thick smoke and suffocating heat. The only reprieve is the occasional overflow vent of hot steam from the boilers.

Stokers are the workers who keep the fires burning. Shoveling coal, shaping the flames, venting the steam. They learn the rhythm of fire and the signs of a pipe about to burst.

_You see something in the smoke and flames no one else does. What is it?_

_The overseers thought it would be funny to lock you all in the furnace room. Who did you lose that day?_

### Mission

#### Actions

- **Brace <Flame className="inline-block mb-3" />:** Prepare for a sudden pain or shock.
- **Fuel <VenetianMask className="inline-block mb-1" />:** Inflame a fire or strong emotion.

### The Churn

#### Contacts

- **[name]:** A stoker who's learned to direct steam to other parts of the factory.
- **[name]:** A worker who swears the water from the overflow vents has healing properties.

#### Subsistence

**Critical Benefit:** You siphon off some of the steam for yourself. Gain 1 **water**.

**Failure Consequence** (choose one):

- The furnace room's smoke is poisoning you. Add a level 1 permanent harm: "black lung".
- The furnace is missing a crucial part that no one knows how to fix. Advance the **Detonation** clock by 1.
