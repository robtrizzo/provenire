# Backgrounds

Day in and day out. Generation after generation. The price of living in the Steel Trap is labor. The overseers demand harsh quotas and dole out harsher punishments at their whims. The workers of the Steel Trap toil on and withstand the humiliations and cruelties of their overseers. Their families depend on the meager scraps they bring home.

Your Background is the job your character labors in the factory. It grants them unique character questions, actions, contacts, and dangers to overcome in the [Subsistence](/game/the-churn#subsistence) Phase.

As the story goes, the Steel Trap's machinery was designed by a man inspired by divine dreams. Archivists are the few capable of reading, so are tasked with interpreting the cryptic scrawlings he left behind. Despite the Archivist's best efforts, the notes are incomplete and what little there is, is often incomprehensible.

When Archivists aren't studying, they're made responsible for keeping track of the factory's inventory. Not that they're given any authority to do anything about discrepencies. They're just supposed to know. And when things go wrong, they're the ones who get punished.

Others in the factory apporach Archivists with caution. They're said to be bad luck; if anything is going wrong, you don't want to be around when the overseers come demanding answers from the Archivist in charge. Not only that, the concept of knowing how the machines work by looking at squiggles on parchment makes many workers' skin crawl. No wonder the Archivists all go mad at some point or another.

_You've been having strange dreams about the factory's machinery. What do you see?_

_You've been noticing discrepancies in the factory's inventory. What's missing?_

### Mission

  <span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">
    Keep the fear and enforce the rules
  </span>
</TypographyH2>

Not all overseers are beasts. They employ and coerce plenty of workers into doing their dirty work for them. Enforcers are the ones tasked with keeping the fear alive in the Steel Trap. They know their communities best and can use that knowledge to keep the workers in line.

Not all Enforcers do this willingly. Many have dogged Overseer "patrons" who keep them in line with threats of violence against their families. Others are just as cruel as the overseers themselves.

The other workers' feelings towards the Enforcers are split. Some greet them with smiles and relief, considering them valiant protectors and righteous servants of the King. Others avoid or even curse them, naming them traitors and oppressors.

_Why do you do the overseers' bidding? What happened to you?_

_You know a flaw in the overseers' penal pen security. What is it?_

### Mission

    Living replacement for broken parts
  </span>
</TypographyH2>

The Steel Trap's machinery is always roaring, rattling, and shaking itself apart. Machinists are the ones who crawl into the belly of the matrix and keep it running.

The depths of the machines are unpredictable, shifting day to day. However, their ever-changing anatomy sometimes reveals secrets or treasures consumed by the factory long ago.

The Machinists are a tightly knit group of workers. They bond over the shared hardship of their tasks, advice for one another, and the trauma of losing friends in the squeeze. They don't often acknowledge the impossible things they witness in the inner chambers. Especially not to anyone outside of the group.

_You've found a hidden compartment in the machinery. What's inside?_

_A friend got lost in the matrix and you had to leave them behind. What happened?_

### Mission

#### Actions

- **Interface <Flame className="inline-block mb-3" />:** Work with the machinery to accomplish a task.
- **Squeeze <Activity className="inline-block mb-4" />:** Get into or out of a tight spot.

### The Churn

#### Contacts

- **Rasha** A stranger who's been living in the machines for years. You've never seen them, but they talk to you.

#### Subsistence

**Critical Benefit:** You've found a mangled corpse in the machinery. Gain 1 **blood**.

**Failure Consequence** (choose one):

- The machine's issues require you to squirm deeper and deeper. Advance the **Belly of the Beast** clock by 1.

<TypographyH2 id="Operator">
  <span className="text-red-500">Operator</span>
  <span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">
    Pull levers and crank wheels
  </span>
</TypographyH2>

The Steel Trap's blast doors and heavy machinery require constant manpower to keep running. Workers are expected to work their bodies ceaselessly to keep the hammers beating. Some don't survive the physical toll. Others are driven mad by the monotony.

Operators are the ones who meet the physical demand and train their minds to endure the repetition. The levers and wheels are a crucible that slowly reinforces their bodies and minds. This is why they are also the harbingers of *dreamstorms*. Where others flee the natural disasters, Operators are tasked with enduring them long enough to raise the alarm and give others a chance to escape.

Operators are a chatty bunch, gossiping to pass the endless hours of dull labor. There's a lot of comraderie to be found in their small pods, and they often go out of their way to help each other even off-shift. That being said, other workers think of them as dull brutes.

_What form of medidation have you learned to stave off the boredom?_

_A fellow worker hasn't been meeting quotas and you're not strong enough to cover for them. Who are they?_

### Mission

#### Actions

- **Disconnect <Flame className="inline-block mb-3" />:** Fortify your mind against upsetting stimuli.
- **Pull <Activity className="inline-block mb-4" />:** Move something heavy or difficult.

### The Churn

#### Contacts

- **Sigsvult:** A shaman whose salves and tinctures ease the pain of the factory's labor.
- **Nimund:** An operator who is a monster of a person. They could do the work of three people if they chose to.

#### Subsistence

**Critical Benefit:** You demonstrate constitution to those around you. Gain 1 **rep**.

**Failure Consequence** (choose one):

- The stressed out workers get into a fight. Gain 2 **heat**.
- Your body is slowly deteriorating from the constant strain. Advance the **Wear and Tear** clock by 1.

  <span className="text-red-500">Runner</span>
  <span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">
    Carry messages and transport crates
  </span>
</TypographyH2>

The Steel Trap is a labyrinth of corridors, catwalks, and machinery. Runners are the ones who navigate the maze to deliver messages and goods. Their memories have to be sharp and their legs strong to keep up with the demands of the factory.

Where none of the workers except Archivists learn to read, Runners have invented something of a secret language they share - *Runner's Scrawl*. It's a mix of drawn symbols accompanied by inconspicuous debris left near the scribbles. This is how runners warn each other about roaming overseers as well as communicate the goings ons of workers and overseers alike.

Other workers are suspicious of Runners - the lackeys and messengers of the overseers. Spies, even. In the lanes and labyrinths, Runners look out for each other, but outside of that, even Runners are suspicious of each other. Most go out of their way to lie about their job, coming up with whatever cover they can. The ones people know about live an isolated life, rooms falling silent when they enter.

_Two overseers are plotting against each other. What are they planning?_

_An overseer took a shipment from you and framed you for it. What was in the shipment?_

### Mission

#### Actions

- **Carry <Activity className="inline-block mb-4" />:** Traverse the factory while under a heavy load.
- **Eavesdrop <VenetianMask className="inline-block mb-1" />:** Listen in on a conversation without being noticed.

### The Churn

#### Contacts

- **Tovarus:** A runner who claims to have seen the outside world.
- **Gelimer:** A community leader who uses runners to keep tabs on the overseers.

#### Subsistence

**Critical Benefit:** You've overhear the overseers planning. Gain 1 **intel**.

**Failure Consequence** (choose one):

- You get cornered by an overseer and forced to talk. The crew loses 1 **intel**.
- You deliver another shipment to a seemingly secret project. Advance the **Dreadful Cargo** clock by 1.

    Sort broken parts and salvage scrap
  </span>
</TypographyH2>

Broken parts and defective products are a fact of life in the Steel Trap. Each one tells a story about the machines that made them and the workers who were blamed for the failure. But materials aren't infinite. Workers are expected to sort through the refuse to fix the machines and enrich the overseers.

Scrappers are the ones coordinated enough to move through the dangerous piles of machinery innards and imaginative enough to see the potential of blasted pieces.

Scrappers are fairly popular among the workers, who assume that they're collecting useful trinkets beneath the overseers' noses. The assumption is usually right - many Scrappers trading food and favors for goggles, buckles, and gloves. These merchants of a kind can get quite competetive, pushing into each others' territories, hiring gangs of bodyguards or thugs to help.

_You've found a nearly functional weapon meant for Fenrir's soldiers. What is it?_

_All your life you've heard whispered stories about the curse of the scrapyard. What have you experienced that makes you think they're right?_

### Mission

#### Actions

- **Step <Activity className="inline-block mb-4" />:** Move carefully through dangerous terrain.
- **Rummage <VenetianMask className="inline-block mb-1" />:** Search through refuse for something useful.

### The Churn

#### Contacts

- **Lorel:** A scrapper who's been hoarding useless scrap for years.
- **Lorya:** An overseer with a penchant for collecting rare and dangerous materials.

#### Subsistence

**Critical Benefit:** You've found a workable piece of scrap. Gain 1 **material**.

**Failure Consequence** (choose one):

- Some scrap you recovered is actually worse than you thought. One piece of the crew's equipment is damaged.
- You hear ominous noises in the scrapyard that follow you home. Advance the **Scrapyard Curse** clock by 1.

<TypographyH2 id="Stoker">
  <span className="text-red-500">Stoker</span>
  <span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">
    Shovel tar and stoke the fires
  </span>
</TypographyH2>

The Steel Trap's machines are powered by monstrous furnaces that must burn day and night. These furnace rooms are clouded with thick smoke and suffocating heat. The only reprieve is the occasional overflow vent of hot steam from the boilers.

Stokers are the workers who learn the rhythm of fire. Pumping and containing tar - which is ever so eager to escape. Shaping the flames which are happy to lap at their turned backs. Venting steam when the pressure has built to a critical whistle.

Many workers envy the Stokers. It's a tough job, yeah; but often the one least disturbed by enforcers and overseers. For that reason, the furnaces are something of a refuge for many who need a quiet hour or place to lay low. The Stokers maintain a culture of helping anyone who comes to them - and keeping quiet about it.

_You see something in the smoke and flames no one else does. What is it?_

_The overseers thought it would be funny to lock you all in the furnace room. Who did you lose that day?_

### Mission

#### Actions

- **Brace <Flame className="inline-block mb-3" />:** Prepare for a sudden pain or shock.
- **Fuel <VenetianMask className="inline-block mb-1" />:** Inflame a fire or strong emotion.

### The Churn

#### Contacts

- **Wilgefort:** A stoker who's learned to direct steam to other parts of the factory.
- **Gisa:** A worker who swears the water from the overflow vents has healing properties.

#### Subsistence

**Critical Benefit:** You siphon off some of the steam for yourself. Gain 1 **water**.

**Failure Consequence** (choose one):

- The furnace room's smoke is poisoning you. Add a level 1 permanent harm: "black lung".
- The furnace is missing a crucial part that no one knows how to fix. Advance the **Detonation** clock by 1.
