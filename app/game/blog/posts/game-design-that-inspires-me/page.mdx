# Game design that inspires me

I've been playing TTRPGs since I was a kid. They sparked my imagination in the kind of way where I could pour endless time thinking and daydreaming and never find a limit on the excitement they brought me. I've had a fascination with that feeling and how I could recreate it for others.

## D&D 3.5e

This system is where I got my start. My mom and uncle had played D&D as kids and so my parents got me the 3.5e starter kit when I turned 10. I remember the excitement of reading the 15 page rulebook and reveling in the endless possibilities of 10 dungeon tiles and the 3 levels of 4 classes provided. When I saved up and bought the Player's Handbook I was blown away by the volume of choice and complexity it provided.

You heard me right. I liked the complexity. I didn't know why yet and it took me years to figure it out. But in the meantime, I collected more and more books and I even ran a session or two between age 10 and 14. Most of the time though, I enjoyed reading the books, fantasizing about possibilities, and creating characters that I would play on my own. It sounds a little sad, but I promise it was not. I was having a blast.

In high school I met some incredible friends and we played several campaigns together. We had a ton of fun, though there was an evergreen snag between myself (who GMd most of the time) and the players. The rules were incredibly complex. This was something I liked, but they felt was a barrier to fun. In many ways I agree. If someone wants to vault over a table, kick over a chair, and stab a goblin in the face, they should be able to do that. In 3.5e, it was pretty difficult to articulate that in the rules and it would require multiple turns to do using the rules as written (RAW).

The thing that snagged me was that I always had an inexplicable feeling that the complexity was worth it. Years later it came to me when I was teaching the game to a new friend. I told them,

> "The rules are there to protect the players from a bad GM and the GM from bad players."

This was a bit harsh of an opinion to have. There's a grain of truth to it, but it's not the whole story. That isn't the topic of this post though, perhaps I'll save it for another time. The important bit is after I had said it, I had the epiphany of why I liked the complexity of 3.5e. The GM never has to make anything up.

For anything, and I mean *anything*, there is a rule or subsystem to accomplish it in 3.5e. This is a double-edged sword to be sure, but the upside felt so important to me. The players could trust that I the GM wasn't arbitrarily making their lives difficult. In fact, I was helping them by making sure the rules were interpreted correctly. There was never a time when a player could point at something and ask "Well why would you design it that way?"

This felt truly important to me. Instead of the players making decisions in a cloud of uncertainty where the whims of the GM dictate the way things work, they were making decisions in a simulation where the consistent rules made sure that each and ever decision of theirs *mattered*.

I understand that player decisions can matter even in a system where the GM does make up rules and subsystems. I've run games like that myself. The important takeaway is that **knowing the players' decisions truly matter is a powerful feeling**. One way to help accomplish that is to ensure the rules encompass anything that can happen in the game. I'm in search of a way to do this without the complexity of 3.5e.

## Pathfinder 1e

In college, I met more incredible friends and we played more D&D 3.5e. At some point though, we got tired of the staggering difference in power between martial and magical classes. So we played a few games of Pathfinder 1e. It was a lot of fun. It helped with the issue of martial vs magical classes, but didn't solve it. We were fine with that though. We were having fun.

One of the greatest parts of Pathfinder 1e was the volume of options. It was like 3.5e but more. More classes, more feats, more spells, more everything. It was a lot of fun to build characters in that system. I remember spending hours on the d20pfsrd website looking at all the options and dreaming up combinations of abilities that the players could use to accomplish their ideas for their characters.

The complexity was still there too - perhaps even moreso than 3.5e. It became a bit of a snag since we were all busy with classes and didn't have the time to obsessively memorize all the rules. Instead we obsessively read all of the character options! Because of the near infinite options in Patherinder 1e, it really expanded on the variety of characters the players could create. And because of that, it expanded the variety of stories we could tell.

At that time, some of those friends were getting me into more anime, scifi, and classic cinema. It was really fun and eye-opening to see how many different ways a fantasy setting could look. The scope of my imagination expanded from the typical Tolkien-esque fantasy to include all sorts of genres and settings. I was ready to try something new, but I couldn't figure out a good way to do that in Pathfinder 1e.

But the key takeaway from Pathfinder 1e was that **variety of options allows players to express themselves**. I'm certain that in whatever system I design, I want to be sure that players can express both their character concept and gameplay style in a way that feels satisfying to them.

## West Marches

Back in college (and still to this day) I'm an avid fan of Matthew Coleville and the MCDM team. My friends and I were among the first 100 subscribers to his channel and we watched nearly every video he released. If you ever see this, hi Matt! Your content is exceptional. For anyone who hasn't seen his channel, I highly recommend it. He has a lot of great advice for GMs and players alike.

One of Matt's videos is about the West Marches campaign style. It's a method of running a game outside of any particular system. Matt's video breaks it down in depth, but I'll do my best to summarize it here. There can be any number of players in the game. When players want to play, they contact the GM with a time and concept of what they want to do, and then they play. The players' actions in the game world are persistent. Other players can hear about what went down or even experience the aftermath of previous sessions. It's almost MMORPG-like, but with custom content created by the GM.

What stuck with me about this were two things. One - I'm the kind of guy who hates to exclude anyone. I want to be able to bring in all of my friends who want to play. This has gotten me into trouble in the past as game groups get bigger and bigger. The players who remember when we had 3-4 player sessions really missed the intimacy of those games. I did too, but I felt it was a necessary sacrifice to include as many people as I could. The West Marches style of play allows for any number of players to play, but only a few at a time. This was a great solution to my problem.

Two - there's a feeling of continuity and mystery that the West Marches style of play provides. Players get to see the world change as a result of everyone's collective actions. This is a **your decisions matter** kind of feeling that I really like. It also leaves plenty of information for the players to discover by talking to each other. They get to have stories to tell each other about what went down in their sessions. They can also keep secrets or create mysteries for the other players to solve. This **asymmetrical information sharing is a concept near and dear to my heart since I think it's a wonderful way to lead players to make decisions closer to what the character would make**.

I still haven't run a West Marches style game, but I've had the pleasure of playing in one. But more on that later!

## Curse of Strahd (D&D 5e)

I got to play in a 5e Curse of Strahd campaign from start to finish. Myself along many other college and highschool friends would gather at the GM's house for a few days around New Year's or 4th of July and play for the majority of each day. It was a blast and I loved the experience as a whole. What struck me about that campaign was though it is grim, the GM kept the tone light. We had plenty of moments of levity but never lost the sense of weight and dread that the campaign is known for.

I'm a big fan of grim and heavy stories. It's something that I've always been drawn to and it comes through in my games quite a lot. There *are* light moments and moments of levity in my games, though I think they become overshadowed by the darkness. What sticks with me about that Curse of Strahd campaign from a game design perspective is that **the tone of the game can be set by the GM outside of the setting**. This is something I'm still working to find the right balance of.

## Spheres of Power

I want to circle back to a sentiment I'd talked about in the Pathfinder 1e section. My friends and I were searching for ways to play games that told new kinds of stories outside of the typical Tolkien-esque fantasy. What I struggled with the most was the class system and magic system of Pathfinder 1e. There are so many combinations of characters you can make, but to be fair to players it felt like no matter what kind of world or story I wanted to make, it had to have room for any and all of Pathfinder 1e's content.

On forums I saw a lot of people talking about Apocalypse World and Powered by the Apocalypse game systems. For some odd reason I disregarded anything that wasn't a d20 based system and kept searching. My first thought was Pathfinder 1e homebrew. I combed through every link on the d20pfsrd website looking for new class systems. One of the links lead to a system called Spheres of Power. It's a 3rd party system created by Drop Dead Studios for Pathfinder 1e and now for D&D 5e as well. The key feature to the system is that all magic and martial abilities are trimmed down to be more bit sized and able to be chosen a la carte. This means that players can create characters with gameplay mechanics that nearly *exactly* match whatever concept they can think of in a way that Pathfinder 1e couldn't.

I was blown away in a way I hadn't been since first reading through the D&D 3.5e Player's Handbook. The expansive options and endless possibilities set my imagination running wild yet again. I designed a campaign setting to run a Pathfinder 1e / Spheres of Power game in. That was the origin of the Provenire setting. Spheres of Power was a perfect fit for the setting because of the modularity and balance of the system. It allowed me to create a setting with its own history and flavor of power divorced from the Vancian magic system of D&D 3.5e and Pathfinder 1e.

A major drawback to Pathfinder 1e plus Spheres of Power is that eventually the complexity becomes overwhelming. By level 15, each player had more than 40 unique abilities I had to account for. I found myself spending hours designing combats and playtesting them over and over just to present a worthy challenge to the players without killing them outright. It was fun, but it was so much work that it became a barrier to running the game.

The key takeaway from Spheres of Power is that **modular ability selection allows players to build a character that narratively and mechanically reflects their concept without added baggage, but too much granularity can create overwhelming mathematical complexity.**

## Pathfinder 2e

After running two campaigns in the Provenire setting, myself and my friends were looking to switch things up and perhaps play something simpler. We'd all played in a lot of D&D 5e and that was a little too simple for our tasts, so we decided to try Pathfinder 2e. The system had two main features that excited me as a GM the most: the three-action turn economy and the incredibly well-balanced math. I wanted to stick to RAW as much as possible to get the full benefits of the system, and I was not disappointed.

Pathfinder 2e has it's faults, but the math is not one of them. In the core rulebook they provide tools to design encounters for any level of party and desired difficulty of the combat. It works incredibly well. I never had to spend more than 30 minutes balancing an encounter because I could grab monsters at the appropriate challenge ratings, add some hazards, and I was good to go. They even provide a precise way to re-skin other monsters to be whatever challenge rating you need them to be. From the perspective of a GM, it's a dream. And the three-action system is a great way to simplify one of the biggest rule-heavy parts of Pathfinder 1e.

There was a snag though - because the math in Pathfinder 2e was so well balanced, the players felt like they were missing out on class abilities giving them something *exciting*. That's not to say that there aren't exciting class features, but I interpret it as: "I miss the asymmetrical strengths of other editions." There are mechanical and mathematical differences between classes in Pathfinder 2e, but they are far smaller than in any other system I've played. This was intentional on Paizo's part I believe. It makes it so that it's nearly impossible to build a bad character, which is an incredible game design accomplishment. But what they lost in their approach was the excitement of having incredible abilities that no one else can do.

The key takeaway I got from Pathfinder 2e is that **bounded math is a powerful tool for the GM to spend less time prepping, but making all classes and options egalitarian can lead to a lack of player satisfaction.**

## The Sprawl (Powered by the Apocalypse)

While running Pathfinder 2e, I already had my mind on the next new system to try. This is a common habit of mine for better or worse. I remembered seeing forum posts about Powered by the Apocalypse games and Apocalypse World and I decided to take a closer look. One afternoon I was hanging out in a group gaming Discord call and chatting about how Apocalypse World seemed interesting. Coincidentally, one of the people in the call was incredibly knowledgeable about the system and many other PbtA games. We talked for hours about systems and he gave me many great recommendations. They have a [blog about game design](https://kludge.bearblog.dev/blog/) as well, you should check it out! Eventually we became close friends and he invited me to a campaign of Masks (more on that later!) I read over as many PbtA books as I could and decided to run a few sessions of The Sprawl.

The Sprawl is a cyberpunk-themed PbtA game where the players are edgerunners trying to make it in the corporate dystopia of the future. It has most of the features of PbtA with some small infliences from Blades in the Dark - which I could only identify later once I'd tried that system. Anyway, I digress. It was a ton of fun! They players were quick to get over the learning curve and we were able to have a couple of action packed missions.

It left a big impression on me. The concept of progress clocks captured my imagination. It gave a framework of creating challenges for the players that were more temporal than I felt I had the tools to create in systems without clocks. It also gave me a way to create setbacks and consequences for the players that felt more natural than being forced into screwing up the current situation. Next, the bounded math of the dice reminded me a lot of Pathfinder 2e, but without the downside of egalitarian class options - and that was because of playbooks and moves. I know that playbooks and moves are literally synonimous with classes and abilities but there's one big difference to me. Moves often gave structure to how to mechanically accomplish a narrative rather than adjusting how the math works. It was an *aha* moment for me - **moves are narrative game design**. This is what I'd been looking for!

## Masks

The friend I'd made by talking about TTRPGs and Powered by the Apocalypse game systems invited me to play in a campaign of Masks he was going to run. I was thrilled to be invited and excited to be a player, which isn't something I got to do often! Masks is a PbtA game where the players are teenage superheroes. Because players lived all across the country, we played over Discord and Roll20. When I landed in the Discord server, I saw more than a dozen other people. I immediately thought - "Woah, how is he going to pull *this* off?" Turns out he planned to run the game West Marches style! I told you I'd get back to that.

Before I talk about mechanics and game design, I do have to say how much fun I had in this game. Hats off to my friend for running such a great campaign! Okay, into the mechanics.

The first piece of game design that sticks with me is the implementation of West Marches. Rather than have the players approach with a time and mission, the GM would post a date he was available to run the game and wait until 4 or 5 people emoted availability as well. Those people would pick from a predefined list of missions the GM had loosely prepped and they'd play. This was a great way to address two of the biggest issues I'd had with West Marches - the GM's availability and the difficulty to prep missions defined by the players. This way, the GM could ensure that every session tied into the overall narrative he was weaving. He would write up post session summaries that gave the gist of what happened, but leave plenty of details for players to share with each other or discover in future sessions.

The second concept is the way Masks handles hit points: conditions. Each character has five conditions they can mark (which acts as 5 HP.) The twist is that each condition is an emotional state the character is in - and each has something shitty the character can do to clear the condition. This gave the players mechanical texture to explore their character's emotional states and kept them immersed in the experience of being a stressed out superhero! Something I especially liked was that it encouraged interpersonal drama between the characters (not players!) which ended up being some of the most meaningful role-playing moments of the campaign.

Lastly was the narrative agency given to each player. The GM is the main person to credit this to, they ran it in such a way that every player's narrative desires were the highest priority. They accomplished this with a mix of great questions and a willingness to let the players take the story by the wheel. Masks had a mechanic for this as well that became a key method for this to happen: Moments of Truth. Each character can unlock a Moment of Truth once or twice by leveling up. When they use it, they get to become the narrator for a short time. Thinking back to my quote a few years back about the rules - me from back then would have balked at the concept of the Moment of Truth. But no one abused it. Everyone used it to add more to the game than they got from it.

The GM added one final touch of narrative liberty that he called the Death Flag. Normally in Masks, when you fall to 0 hit points (marking a condition when all are already marked), you decide what happens to them that causes them to be removed from the scene. That *can* be death, but it can be anything consistent with the narrative. The Death Flag became a way for players to signal "I'm okay with my character dying here." This was a good rule for a few reasons. Some players aren't comfortable with their character dying, some players want to make sure their character's death is meaningful, and some players like the adrenaline rush of knowing their character could die at any moment. It was a great way to give players control over their character's fate - and agency over the narrative.

I learned a lot about game design from the year I played in that Masks game. I don't think I can summarize a takeaway in one clean line, but I can say that there is a lot of that game that I hope to replicate in games I run in the future.

## Blades in the Dark

This was a system I'd heard a lot about from friends and the internet. One summer weekend, a group of friends and I picked up the rulebook from the local game store and gave it a shot! Even better - I got to be a player! Blades in the Dark is a PbtA game, but it innovates on enough of the core mechanics to make it something of its own. The game is about a crew of scoundrels trying to get rich in the haunted city of Doskvol. The game is a mix of heist movie, gangster movie, and supernatural horror. It's a lot of fun!

The first major change BitD makes to the PbtA formula is the dice. Instead of rolling 2d6+stat, you roll a pool of d6s equal to your stat and pick the highest. This still allowed for the bounded math of PbtA, but it gave the game just a little bit more texture. In addition, they introduced the concept of position and effect which gives the players and GM a framework of how difficult a task is and how much of an impact it will have on the scene. This removed the anxious uncertainty that would sometimes arise from players not wanting to metagame the difficulty of a task. It also allowed for a huge range of possibilities resulting from a dice roll while sticking to simple dice mechanics!

The second major change is the way the game handles downtime. Instead of having a session end when the action ends, the game has a structured downtime phase where the players can do a variety of things to prepare for the next score. This is something I realized my GM in Masks had brought into their game as well. It gave the players a space to develop their characters and the world outside of the action. The Churn quickly became something to look forward to - which I'd say is a sign of good game design!

The third piece is less of an innovation but more of some really solid GMing advice. Blades in the Dark encourages the GM to cut straight to the action, ignoring the boring parts of the story. This is something I almost never did when running D&D or Pathfinder because I was so stuck in running the game as it was "intended." This pulled the wool from my eyes and let me see the wonderful world of only playing the fun parts! BitD did incorporate a mechanic to lean into this called Flashbacks. It lets players retroactively prepare and plan for situations that their genius characters could have seen coming, but of course we should not burden the players with accounting for.

My key takeaways from Blades in the Dark are **communicating stakes and potential outcomes to the players, strucutred downtime, and only playing the fun parts** make for a much better experience overall.

## Open Strategy Game

This is a term coined by the same GM that ran the game of Masks I played in (yeah, he's a much recurring character in this post!) It's inspired by Matrix Games run by think-tanks and military organizations. The idea is that the players are given a brief description of a setting and scenario, assigned an actor in the situation, and given a few concrete goals to accomplish. The game takes place asynchronously where they turns can be a day, a week, or even longer. At the end of the turn, players submit their actions to the GM who then resolves them and sends reports back to the players.

It's a cool and unique style of play! What got me so excited about it is that it gives a whole new scope and lense from which the players can take actions. It's a great way to explore a narrative set across a large area and/or long period of time. It also gives players plenty of time to think about their next action.

I got so excited by the concept that I decided to run one of my own - though it balooned in scope and ended up being much closer to a traditional role playing game. It was still lots of fun - but it's a story for another time!

The key takeaway from the Open Strategy Game framework is that **asynchronous play can give players a new perspective on the game world and allow for play that is closer to narrative than traditional TTRPGs.**.

## Daggerheart

In the middle of the OSG, the GM who ran Curse of Strahd invited me to play in a short playtest of the Daggerheart Beta. At the time of writing this, it's a game system in development designed to deliver on the concepts that D&D 5e tries to execute on but falls short of (my words, not the Daggerheart designers'). The pieces of Daggerheart I got excited by don't have to do with dice mechanics, but instead they're features that could be incorporated into any game system.

The first is the way they handle skills. In all editions of D&D and Pathfinder, there's some friction between the concept of a character having had a profession or background in something versus their skills as defined by the game. We were often left scratching our heads thinking "I guess Athletics applies to being a lumberjack?" Daggerheart inverts this relationship - instead of a list of skills, the character has a list of backgrounds which *become* the character's skills. Great way to marry the narrative and mechanical aspects of a character!

Next is the initiative system. I think I'd heard of this method of initiative before, but at this moment I'd come from a background of strict roll-based initiative from d20 based games and a total lack of initiative in PbtA games. Both systems work *okay*, but I always wanted something a little better. I don't like the tedium of tracking a long list of initiative counts, but I don't like the way that quieter players end up acting less in a system without initiative order. Daggerheart combines this by having all players take their 3 actions in any order they choose - even splitting their actions up between other players' actions. After the players, then the GM acts. It keeps the game moving quickly and makes sure that everyone gets equal time in the spotlight.

Finally is the way Daggerheart implemented armor and health. It's a bit complicated at first, but I'll do my best to explain. If you're familiar with Armor Class in D&D, Daggerheart still has that, though it's pretty low for everyone. So odds are - you're going to get hit pretty often, but you *can* dodge. When you do get hit, the damage is compared to your Damage Thresholds. These thresholds define the amount of damage required to make you lose 1, 2, or 3 hit points. If you choose, you can allow your armor to get damaged to reduce the damage, possibly reducing a threshold or more. There's so much texture to this system and it accounts for the many ways taking damage in a fight can manifest. And on top of that, the math is bounded! You're probably tired of hearing me repeat that - but it makes a huge difference when you're running a game.

Each of these three subsystems really excite me and I'm looking forward to seeing how I can incorporate their concepts into my own game design.
