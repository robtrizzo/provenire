# Blog to myself

Sometimes I need to record my thoughts about game design, so this is somewhere between a journal and a blog. It helps me formulate my thoughts better if I write them in a public place, even if no one reads them.

Posts will be a mixture between stream of conciousness, analyzing past mistakes, and reconciling the many paths I could take to accomplish specific game-design goals.
