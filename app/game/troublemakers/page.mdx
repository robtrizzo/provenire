# Troublemakers

No one breaks the status quo in the Steel Trap. It's guaranteed failure and hardship for your loved ones. But the PCs are different. They're going to pull it off. Their particular brand of Troublemaker shows how they go about it.

Your Troublemaker grants you unique character questions, acions, special abilities, and ways to advance the crew during the Churn.

<span className="text-indigo-500">Chisel</span><span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">A crafty sabetour and wright</span>
</TypographyH2>

The workers of the Steel Trap spend their lives surrounded by the roaring and churning machines of the factory. The Chisel is one of the few who dares to attempt understanding them.

*A dangerous machine you were tampering with lashed out at you. What was the machine and how did it scar you?*

*The factory's every creation leaves behind piles of refuse. What waste do you see as useful materials that others don't?*

### Mission

#### Actions

- **Cobble <Flame className="inline-block mb-3" />:** Rapidly make an improvised tool or weapon from available scrap.
- **Sabotage <VenetianMask className="inline-block mb-1" />:** Tamper with or damage a machine or device.

#### Special Abilities (WIP)

### The Churn

During The Churn, Chisels are designing, forging, and building new equipment for the crew... if only they have the **materials**. Examples are: simple weapons, fragile armor, lockpicks, prybars, *explosives*? These items are equipable by the crew until they become damaged or lost. If the Chisel has no materials, they can only research new designs.

<span className="text-indigo-500">Flywheel</span><span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">A daring scoundrel and acrobat</span>
</TypographyH2>

The Steel Trap is part factory, part prison, part fortress. Many of its rooms and corridors were never desinged to be traversed by humans. Flywheels are one of the few nimble enough to navigate the parts of the factory made only for crows, wolves, and bears.

*The Beast Lanes are dangerous places, and not everyone is as talented as you are. What tragedy has befallen someone who followed you there?*

*Your abilities have allowed you to climb to the top of the factory and see the sky. How did seeing the wider world and starry cosmos affect you?*

### Mission

#### Special Abilities (WIP)

<TypographyH2>
<span className="text-indigo-500">Fume</span><span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">A manipulative and intimidating schemer</span>
</TypographyH2>

The Steel Trap is a place of isolation and loneliness amongst the masses. Fumes pierce people's veneers and glimpse the pain behind their eyes.

*You've seen the worst of the Steel Trap's workers. What is the most desperate thing you've seen someone do?*

*You got too close to one of your informats once. What happened?*

#### Special Abilities (WIP)

### The Churn

During The Churn, Fumes are recruiting informants and gathering dirt. Fumes can spend Intel to turn minor foes into assets and work their way up the hierarchy of the factory. They can also bully or trick other factory workers into being informants. Informants can be sacrificed for Intel if the Fume is willing to risk Heat and possibly other consequences...

<TypographyH2>
<span className="text-indigo-500">Grease</span><span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">A canny and resourceful blunderer</span>
</TypographyH2>

In the midst of the Steel Trap's isolation, tightly knit communities and factions form: often for protection from their fellow workers. Even the overseers have their own factions that don't take kindly to one another. Greases move between these groups, making deals and alliances to keep the crew safe.

*You've made a deal with one of the overseers that went wrong. What did you have to give up to them?*

*A faction in your neighborhood still owes you a favor. Who are they and how did you earn it?*

<TypographyH2>
<span className="text-indigo-500">Hammer</span><span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">A strong and fearless brawler</span>
</TypographyH2>

The Steel Trap's overseers are brutal and cruel. They have no qualms rounding up stray workers and forcing them to fight in the pits in the factory's underbelly. Most don't last long. Hammers are one of the few who show potential to survive.

*You were forced to fight a friend in the pits. Only one of you got to leave. What happened?*

*Which one of the overseers is nervous around you?*

<TypographyH2>
<span className="text-indigo-500">Nail</span><span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">An audacious and inspiring ringleader</span>
</TypographyH2>

There is no hope in the Steel Trap. No one makes trouble and lives for long. But the PCs are different. They can succeed where others have failed. The Nail spreads the word of their success and inspires others to follow.

*You've learned the source of many folks' hopelessness. What could change their minds?*

*Someone you inspired to stand up to the overseers was caught. What happened to them?*

<TypographyH2>
<span className="text-indigo-500">Spark</span><span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">A quick-witted and charming protector</span>
</TypographyH2>

Tension in the Steel Trap is palpable. Tension between overseer and worker. Tension between friends and family. Tension at the foot of fickle machines. Sparks dare to ignite that tension and deal with the consequences.

*You incited an incident between workers and an overseer. It turned ugly. Who couldn't you protect?*

*You convinced two factions with a grudge to settle the score. How well has it turned out?*

### Mission

<TypographyH2>
<span className="text-indigo-500">Vapor</span><span className="text-muted-foreground text-lg ml-8">An elusive infiltrator and thief</span>
</TypographyH2>

The overseers of the Steel Trap frequently deputize workers to spy and beat down their fellows. Vapors use their own tactics against them, posing as an informant to gather information and resources for the crew.

*You were caught in the act of stealing from the overseers. Who did you throw under the bus to get out of trouble?*

*One of the overseers knows what you're up to, but instead of reporting you, they're using you. What do they want?*

### Mission

- **Lift <Activity className="inline-block mb-4" />:** Take something from someone without them noticing.
