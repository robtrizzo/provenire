The **Narrator** may choose to roll entanglements in the "open" or they may choose to roll it secretly. They may bring it into play immediately, or they may wait for a dramatic moment. **Entanglements** manifest fully before the PCs have a chance to avoid them. This is to simplify a complicated situation and make trouble for the characters. Each has a list of potential ways to deal with it. The Players may choose to make it a quick resolution or to dive deep into the scene.

#### Arrest

The overseers move in on one of the PCs to imprison them. They don't need evidence and they don't come alone, they often bring a gang of enforcers with them. Throw other workers uner the bus and lose **goodwill** equal to **2 + wanted level**, hand your PC over (this clears your heat), or try to evade capture.

#### Cooperation

A friendly faction asks you for a favor. Agree to do it or sacrifice **4 rep** or incur **1 scorn** with them. If you don't have a friendly faction, you avoid entanglements right now.

#### Dreamstorm

A deadly natural disaster strikes the factory. The PCs and their loved ones are directly in its path. The players may choose to play out the scene or make a **resistance roll** in each attribute and narrate how they survive.

#### Factory Mishap

The factory's machinery in your home turn goes haywire. Acquire the services of an **archivist** and **machinist**, or deal with it yourself.

#### Flipped

One of your PC's rivals arranges for one of your contacts, patrons, clients, or group of workers to switch allegiances due to the **heat** on you. They're loyal to another faction now.

#### Gang Trouble

One of your gangs or cohorts causes trouble due to their flaws. You lose face (forfeit **goodwill** equal to your **wanted level**), make an example of one of the gang members, or face reprisals from the wronged party (incur **1 scorn**).

#### Interrogation

Enforcers round up one of the PCs to question them about the crew's crimes. Either you pay them off with **2 food** or they beat you up (**level 2 harm**) and you tell them what they want to know (**+3 heat**). You can resist each of thoe consequences separately.

#### Questioning

Enforcers grab an NPC member of the crew or one of the crew's contacts to question them about your crimes. Make a **fortune roll** to see how much they talk (**1-3: +2 heat, 4/5: +1 heat**), or pay them off with **1 food**.

#### Reprisals

An enemy faction makes a move against you (or a friend, contact, or friendly faction). Pay them (**1 food or 1 material**) per scorn you have with them as an apology, allow them to mess with you or yours, or fight back and show them who's boss.

#### Rivals

A neutral faction throws their weight around. They threaten you, a friend, a contact, or a friendly faction. Forfeit **1 rep** and **1 goodwill** or stand up to them and incur **1 scorn**.

#### Show of Force

A faction with whom you have a negative status with makes a move against you. Give them the territory they're after or fight back and they drop to **3 scorn**.

#### The Usual Suspects

Enforcers grab someone in the periphery of your crew. One player volunteers a bond as the most likely to be taken. Make a **bond roll** to find out if they resist questioning (**1-3: +2 heat, 4/5: level 2 harm**), or pay the enforcers off with **1 food**.
