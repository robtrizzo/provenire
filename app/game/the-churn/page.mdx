# The Churn

During missions, characters are in the thick of it, fighting against the system and the overseers. But what about the time in between? The Churn is the daily struggle. The grind. The treacherous routine of life in the factory. During this time, the characters can't murder their way out of all their promblems. They have to rely on the people around them.

During the Churn, Universal Actions are replaced by Bonds. Characters have Personal, Family, and Professional Bonds in each of Heart, Instinct, and Machina respectively. These Bonds can be advanced like actions can; they represent time and energy the characters are putting into their relationships.

  Subsistence
</TypographyH2>

Not everyone who lives in the factory works. Many are too young, too old, or not cut out for the brutality of the factory floor. These people rely on the labor of their family members to survive. Your character works not only to feed themselves, but to feed their loved ones as well.

During the Churn, there is a **Subsistence** phase. First, each character rolls **fortune** and increases the **Starvation** clock by the result: **1-3:** three, **4/5:** two, **6:** one. If the **Starvation** clock fills, one of the character's family members perishes from hunger.

After the **Starvation** clock has been advanced, the PC labors in the dangerous conditions dictated by their Background. They roll an action that must include one granted by their Background to determine results. You may choose to spend 1 **food** to reduce the **Starvation** clock by 1 during downtime.

- **Critical Success:** As success, but gain an additional benefit according to your Background.
- **Success:** You've earned enough to feed your family and yourself. Reduce the **Starvation** clock by 2.
- **Partial Success:** As success, but suffer consequences according to your Background.
- **Failure:** You've earned nothing. Mark a level one permanent harm: "hungry". This cannot be healed until you eat. Suffer consequences according to your Background.

  Agendas
</TypographyH2>

Just because the mission is over doesn't mean your work is done. In the spare hours between labor and home, you squeeze every drop of advantage you can out of your time. To your family and loved ones, you're suddenly not around as much. Last one to bed. First to rise. Missing meals and skipping out on family events. But you're doing it for them. You're doing it for the crew. You're doing it because no one else will.

During the Churn, there is an **Agendas** phase. Each Skillset has a list of unique upgrades or special projects they can pursue. Once completed or achieved, they apply to the entire crew.

When you are rolling for an Agenda, your roll must include one of the actions granted by your Skillset. You may also choose to add a **Heat** die to the **Entanglements** dice pool in exchange for **+1d** on your action.

<TypographyH2 id="downtime">
  Downtime
</TypographyH2>

In the short time left after **subsistence** and **agendas**, your character can tend to their friends, family, community, and themselves. Each character gets two downtime actions. You can choose the same option twice.

### Downtime Actions

#### Comfort
When you comfort someone, you might be a shoulder to cry on, a listening ear, or a source of tough love. When you comfort someone, name a piece of actionable advice and make a **[project roll](/game/the-churn#project-rolls)**. The character you comfort can choose to take the advice or reject it. If they take the advice, they mark a number of segments on their **recovery clock** according to the result. If they reject the advice, you mark an amount of stress equal to the result.

#### Long Term Project
Work on a long term project not encompassed by the other agendas or downtime activities. This can cover a wide range of activities like puzzling out a mystery, gaining someone's trust, or building a unique item. Based on the goal of the project, the GM will tell you the clock(s) to create and suggest a method by which you might make progress. To advance a long term project, make a **[project roll](/game/the-churn#project-rolls)** as normal.

#### Recover
When you recover, you seek treatment and heal your harm. You might visit a Bond or Contact who can help you, or you might rely on your own skills. Failing that, you bedrest and hope for the best. When you recover, make a **[project roll](/game/the-churn#project-rolls)** and mark a number of segments on the **healing clock** according to the result. When you fill your healing clock, reduce each instance of harm on your sheet by one level, then clear the clock. If you have more segments to mark, they "roll over".

Some harm can't be healed by normal means. Examples incude "hungry" and "tired". These can have their levels reduced by recovery, but require specific actions to heal engirely.

#### Relax
When you relax, you seek out comfort, peace, or vice. Whatever your character feels they need to reduce the stress of risking their lives on missions. When you relax, roll your lowest **attribute**. The result determines how much stress you clear.

If you would clear more stress than you have, it represents overindulgence or neglecting other parts of your life that need attention. Mark an amount of stress equal to the "roll over".

#### Shift Blame
When you shift blame, you're trying to reduce the crew's heat generated in missions. You might be spreading rumors, bribing officials, or framing someone else for your crimes. Whatever your approach, you need a scapegoat. Name them and make a **[project roll](/game/the-churn#project-rolls)**. The result determines how much heat you can reduce.

#### Train
When you spend time training, **mark 1 xp** on the xp track for an attribute or mission advancement. _You can only train a given xp track once per downtime._

<TypographyH2 id="project-rolls">
  Project Rolls
</TypographyH2>

During The Churn, there are many types of projects which the characters can undertake. Those projects are represented by a **clock** set by the rules or the GM. Before rolling for a project, the player decides the approach they want to take to pursue it. The GM then sets position and effect and the player rolls. The effect and roll together determines how much progress is made on the clock. Consequences of failure depend on the posistion as normal.
