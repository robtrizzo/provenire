# The Churn

During missions, characters are in the thick of it, fighting against the system and the overseers. But what about the time in between? The Churn is the daily struggle. The grind. The treacherous routine of life in the factory. During this time, the characters can't murder their way out of all their promblems. They have to rely on the people around them.

During the Churn, Universal Actions are replaced by Bonds. Characters have Personal, Family, and Professional Bonds in each of Heart, Instinct, and Machina respectively. These Bonds can be advanced like actions can; they represent time and energy the characters are putting into their relationships.

At this time, the converation is shifted to an even balance between player and **Narrator**. The players ahve more narrative control to describe the things and people around them, though the **Narrator** will still call for particular actions and/or rolls during the Churn's phases.

<TypographyH3 id="heat">Heat</TypographyH3>

The Steel Trap is a place of prying eyes, informants, and cunning overseers. Anything you do might be witnessed, and there's always evidence left behind. To represent this, the crew accumulates **heat** as they cause trouble. After a **mission** *or* conflict with an opponent, the crew takes **heat** according to the following:

- **0 heat**: Smooth & quiet; low exposure
- **2 heat**: Contained: standard exposure
- **4 heat**: Loud & chaotic; high exposure
- **6 heat**: Wild; devastating exposure

*Did you keep your crew's involvement in the mission under wraps?* **-4 heat**.

Add **+1 heat** if an overseer was the target.

Add **+1 heat** if the mission took place outside of scouted territory.

Add **+1 heat** if combat was involved; an additional **+1 heat** if there were enemy survivors.

Add **+2 heat** if anyone in the crew was identified.

When your crew reaches **9 heat**, you gain a **wanted level** and clear your **heat**. *Excess **heat** rolls over*.

The only way to reduce **wanted level** is if a crew member, family member, contact, or framed enemy gets incarcerated. When this happens, reduce your **wanted level** by 1 and clear your **heat**.

<TypographyH4 id="crackdowns">Crackdowns</TypographyH4>

The overseers may appear aloof at times. They prowl the periphery and bark orders. Rarely bothering to do the real work of managing the factory themselves, they're often content to let their enforcers toil on their behalf. The overseers can be stirred to action though. And it won't be pretty. After each mission, ask the crew the following:

- Did we free the workers from their shackles?
- Did we free the workers from their fear?
- Did we free the workers from their despair?
- Did we kill an overseer for the first time?

If the answer to any of these is "yes", it triggers a **Crackdown**. The overseers will come out in force to punish every worker in the wing of the factory suspected to house the crew. This is a special event that could be played out should the players choose.

### Rewards

Where it is common in heist ficiton for the payoff to be an ambush or rug-pull, that is not something that the PCs should be worrying about every session. In *Provenire*, the **Narrator** does not mess with the **payoff**.

<TypographyH4 id="rep">Rep</TypographyH4>

After a mission, the PCs take stock of the events of the operation. The crew earns **rep** according to one half the **heat** generated by the mission (rounded down, minimum of 1).

<TypographyH4 id="mission-xp">Mission XP</TypographyH4>

At the end of each mission, for each item below mark **1 xp** (in your mission xp or an attribute xp track) or **2 xp** if that item occurred multiple times.

- *You materially improved the conditions of workers in the Steel Trap*
- *You struck fear into your foes' hearts with extreme violence*
- *You expressed your dream, heritage, or background*
- *You struggled with your hurt or conditions*
- *You grew closer to someone in your crew*
- *You grew apart from someone in the crew...* also **strain your bond**<sup className="text-amber-500">*</sup>

<TypographyH2 id="breather">
Taking a Breather
</TypographyH2>
Just after the mission, you may choose to take some time for yourself. When you take a breather, you seek out comfort, peace, or vice. Whatever your character feels they need to reduce the stress of risking their lives on missions. If you do, spend **1 food / material / goodwill** and clear all of your **stress**. If your stress level was **6+**, you overindulge or neglect other parts of your life that need attention. Roll your worst attribute on the **overindulgence table**.

<TypographyH2 id="agendas">
  Agendas
</TypographyH2>

Just because the mission is over doesn't mean your work is done. In the spare hours between labor and home, you squeeze every drop of advantage you can out of your time. To your family and loved ones, you're suddenly not around as much. Last one to bed. First to rise. Missing meals and skipping out on family events. But you're doing it for them. You're doing it for the crew. You're doing it because no one else will.

During the Churn, there is an **Agendas** phase. Each Skillset has a list of unique upgrades or special projects they can pursue. Once completed or achieved, they apply to the entire crew. The players at the table vote on two **agendas** available to their crew to pursue. A PC whose agenda was chosen becomes the **lead**. The **lead** may choose other PCs or NPCs to be scene partners. The **lead** sets the scene: *What's going through their head? What are they struggling with? How did the events of the mission impact their own personal journey?*

The **Narrator** describes the situation, and we play to find out what happens.

When you are rolling for an Agenda, your roll must include one of the actions granted by your Skillset. You may also choose to **raise the stakes** in exchange for **+1d** on your action. This makes entanglements potentially more dramatic.

<TypographyH2 id="agendas">
  Entanglements
</TypographyH2>

Your crew didn't just spring into existence tonight. You have a complex history of favors, commitments, debts, and promises that got you where you are today. To reflect this, after each **agendas phas** you roll dice to find out which **entanglement** comes calling. An entanglement might be a rival, opposing faction, an enforcer, overseer, or even the strange workings of the Steel Trap's machinery.

Entanglements become more severe as your **heat** and **wanted level** increase. They can also be made more intense when players choose to **raise the stakes** during the **agendas phase**.

The **Narrator** rolls in secret. They may choose to introduce the entanglement immediately, or they may bide their time for a dramatic moment *before the next mission*. The **entanglement** manifests fully before the PCs have a chance to avoid it - it cannot be **resisted**. The players may choose to make it a quick resolution or to dive deep into the scene.

<TypographyH2 id="subsistence">
  Subsistence
</TypographyH2>

Not everyone who lives in the factory works. Many are too young, too old, or not cut out for the brutality of the factory floor. These people rely on the labor of their family members to survive. Your character works not only to feed themselves, but to feed their loved ones as well.

During the Churn, there is a **Subsistence** phase. First, each character advances the **Starvation** clock by **2 ticks**. If the **Starvation** clock fills, one of the character's family members perishes from hunger.

> At any time during the **Churn**, a character may choose to spend **1 food** to reduce the **Starvation** clock by **1**. This can be done even if the **Starvation** clock is full.

After the **Starvation** clock has been advanced, the PC labors in the dangerous conditions dictated by their Background. They roll an action that must include one granted by their Background to determine results. You may choose to spend 1 **food** to reduce the **Starvation** clock by 1 during downtime.

- **Critical Success:** As success, but gain an additional benefit according to your Background.
- **Success:** You've earned enough to feed your family and yourself. Reduce the **Starvation** clock by 2.
- **Partial Success:** You work yourself to the bone, but are given scraps nonetheless. Reduce the **Starvation** clock by 1. Suffer consequences according to your Background.
- **Failure:** You've earned nothing. Mark a level one permanent harm: "hungry". This cannot be healed until you eat. Suffer consequences according to your Background.
