# The Churn

During missions, characters are in the thick of it, fighting against the system and the overseers. But what about the time in between? The Churn is the daily struggle. The grind. The treacherous routine of life in the factory. During this time, the characters can't murder their way out of all their promblems. They have to rely on the people around them.

During the Churn, Universal Actions are replaced by Bonds. Characters have Personal, Family, and Professional Bonds in each of Heart, Instinct, and Machina respectively. These Bonds can be advanced like actions can; they represent time and energy the characters are putting into their relationships.

At this time, the converation is shifted to an even balance between player and **Narrator**. The players ahve more narrative control to describe the things and people around them, though the **Narrator** will still call for particular actions and/or rolls during the Churn's phases.

  Payoff
</TypographyH2>

### Rewards

Where it is common in heist ficiton for the payoff to be an ambush or rug-pull, that is not something that the PCs should be worrying about every session. In *Provenire*, the **Narrator** does not mess with the **payoff**.

#### Rep

After a mission, the PCs take stock of the events of the operation. The crew earsn **rep** according to the following:

- *Do you keep your crew's involvement in the mission under wraps?* **Earn 0 rep**.
- *Was the target of the score an individual worker?* **Earn 0 rep**.
- *Was the target of the score a group of workers?* **Earn 1 rep**.
- *Was the target of the score an individual enforcer?* **Earn 2 rep**.
- *Was the target of the score a group of enforcers?* **Earn 3 rep**.
- *Was the target of the score an overseer?* **Earn 4 rep**.

#### Mission XP

At the end of each mission, for each item below mark **1 xp** (in your mission xp or an attribute xp track) or **2 xp** if that item occurred multiple times.

- *You materially improved the conditions of workers in the Steel Trap*
- *You struck fear into your foes' hearts with extreme violence*
- *You expressed your dream, heritage, or background*
- *You struggled with your hurt of conditions*

### Heat

The Steel Trap is a place of prying eyes, informants, and cunning overseers. Anything you do might be witnessed, and there's alays evidence left behind. To represent this, the crew accumulates **heat** as they cause trouble. After a **mission** *or* conflict with an opponent, the crew takes **heat** according to tht efollowing:

- **0 heat**: Smooth & quiet; low exposure
- **2 heat**: Contained: standard exposure
- **4 heat**: Loud & chaotic; high exposure
- **6 heat**: Wild; devastating exposure

Add **+1 heat** if an overseer was the target. Add **+1 heat** if the mission took place outside of scouted territory. Add **+1 heat** if combat was involved; an additional **+1 heat** if there were enemy survivors.

When your crew reaches **9 heat**, you gain a **wanted level** and clear your **heat**. *Excess **heat** rolls over*.

The only way to reduce **wanted level** is if a crew member, family member, contact, or framed enemy gets incarcerated. When this happens, reduce your **wanted level** by 1 and clear your **heat**.

#### Crackdowns

The overseers may appear aloof at times. They prowl the periphery and bark orders. Rarely bothering to do the real work of managing the factory themselves, they're often content to let their enforcers toil on their behalf. The overseers can be stirred to action though. And it won't be pretty. After each mission, ask the crew the following:

- Did we free the workers from their shackles?
- Did we free the workers from their fear?
- Did we free the workers from their despair?
- Did we kill an overseer for the first time?

If the answer to any of these is "yes", it triggers a **Crackdown**. The overseers will come out in force to punish every worker in the wing of the factory suspected to house the crew. This is a special event that could be played out should the players choose.

<TypographyH2 id="subsistence">
  Subsistence
</TypographyH2>

Not everyone who lives in the factory works. Many are too young, too old, or not cut out for the brutality of the factory floor. These people rely on the labor of their family members to survive. Your character works not only to feed themselves, but to feed their loved ones as well.

During the Churn, there is a **Subsistence** phase. First, each character rolls **fortune** and increases the **Starvation** clock by the result: **1-3:** three, **4/5:** two, **6:** one. If the **Starvation** clock fills, one of the character's family members perishes from hunger.

After the **Starvation** clock has been advanced, the PC labors in the dangerous conditions dictated by their Background. They roll an action that must include one granted by their Background to determine results. You may choose to spend 1 **food** to reduce the **Starvation** clock by 1 during downtime.

- **Critical Success:** As success, but gain an additional benefit according to your Background.
- **Success:** You've earned enough to feed your family and yourself. Reduce the **Starvation** clock by 2.
- **Partial Success:** As success, but suffer consequences according to your Background.
- **Failure:** You've earned nothing. Mark a level one permanent harm: "hungry". This cannot be healed until you eat. Suffer consequences according to your Background.

<TypographyH2 id="agendas">
  Agendas
</TypographyH2>

Just because the mission is over doesn't mean your work is done. In the spare hours between labor and home, you squeeze every drop of advantage you can out of your time. To your family and loved ones, you're suddenly not around as much. Last one to bed. First to rise. Missing meals and skipping out on family events. But you're doing it for them. You're doing it for the crew. You're doing it because no one else will.

During the Churn, there is an **Agendas** phase. Each Skillset has a list of unique upgrades or special projects they can pursue. Once completed or achieved, they apply to the entire crew.

When you are rolling for an Agenda, your roll must include one of the actions granted by your Skillset. You may also choose to add a **Heat** die to the **Entanglements** dice pool in exchange for **+1d** on your action.

<TypographyH2 id="agendas">
  Entanglements
</TypographyH2>

Your crew didn't just spring into existence tonight. You have a complex history of favors, commitments, debts,a nd promises that got you where you are today. To reflect this, after each **agendas phas** you roll dice to find out which **entanglement** comes calling. An entanglement might be a rival, opposing faction, an enforcer, overseer, or even the strange workings of the Steel Trap's machinery.

The **Narrator** uses the column according to the crew's **heat** and rolls a number of dice equal to their **wanted level**. Extra dice may have been added during the **agendas phase**.

The **Narrator** may choose to roll entanglements in the "open" or they may choose to roll it secretly. They may bring it into play immediately, or they may wait for a dramatic moment. **Entanglements** manifest fully before the PCs have a chance to avoid them. This is to simplify a complicated situation and make trouble for the characters. Each has a list of potential ways to deal with it. The Players may choose to make it a quick resolution or to dive deep into the scene.

#### Arrest

The overseers move in on one of the PCs to imprison them. They don't need evidence and they don't come alone, they often bring a gang of enforcers with them. Throw other workers uner the bus and lose **goodwill** equal to **2 + wanted level**, hand your PC over (this clears your heat), or try to evade capture.

#### Cooperation

A friendly faction asks you for a favor. Agree to do it or sacrifice **4 rep** or incur **1 scorn** with them. If you don't have a friendly faction, you avoid entanglements right now.

#### Dreamstorm

A deadly natural disaster strikes the factory. The PCs and their loved ones are directly in its path. The players may choose to play out the scene or make a **resistance roll** in each attribute and narrate how they survive.

#### Factory Mishap

The factory's machinery in your home turn goes haywire. Acquire the services of an **archivist** and **machinist**, or deal with it yourself.

#### Flipped

One of your PC's rivals arranges for one of your contacts, patrons, clients, or group of workers to switch allegiances due to the **heat** on you. They're loyal to another faction now.

#### Gang Trouble

One of your gangs or cohorts causes trouble due to their flaws. You lose face (forfeit **goodwill** equal to your **wanted level**), make an example of one of the gang members, or face reprisals from the wronged party (incur **1 scorn**).

#### Interrogation

Enforcers round up one of the PCs to question them about the crew's crimes. Either you pay them off with **2 food** or they beat you up (**level 2 harm**) and you tell them what they want to know (**+3 heat**). You can resist each of thoe consequences separately.

#### Questioning

Enforcers grab an NPC member of the crew or one of the crew's contacts to question them about your crimes. Make a **fortune roll** to see how much they talk (**1-3: +2 heat, 4/5: +1 heat**), or pay them off with **1 food**.

#### Reprisals

An enemy faction makes a move against you (or a friend, contact, or friendly faction). Pay them (**1 food or 1 material**) per scorn you have with them as an apology, allow them to mess with you or yours, or fight back and show them who's boss.

#### Rivals

A neutral faction throws their weight around. They threaten you, a friend, a contact, or a friendly faction. Forfeit **1 rep** and **1 goodwill** or stand up to them and incur **1 scorn**.

#### Show of Force

A faction with whom you have a negative status with makes a move against you. Give them the territory they're after or fight back and they drop to **3 scorn**.

#### The Usual Suspects

Enforcers grab someone in the periphery of your crew. One player volunteers a bond as the most likely to be taken. Make a **bond roll** to find out if they resist questioning (**1-3: +2 heat, 4/5: level 2 harm**), or pay the enforcers off with **1 food**.

<TypographyH2 id="downtime">
  Downtime
</TypographyH2>

In the short time left after **subsistence** and **agendas**, your character can tend to their friends, family, community, and themselves. Each character gets two downtime actions. You can choose the same option twice.

### Downtime Actions

#### Comfort
When you comfort someone, you might be a shoulder to cry on, a listening ear, or a source of tough love. When you comfort someone, name a piece of actionable advice and make a **[project roll](/game/the-churn#project-rolls)**. The character you comfort can choose to take the advice or reject it. If they take the advice, they mark a number of segments on their **recovery clock** according to the result. If they reject the advice, you mark an amount of stress equal to the result.

#### Long Term Project
Work on a long term project not encompassed by the other agendas or downtime activities. This can cover a wide range of activities like puzzling out a mystery, gaining someone's trust, or building a unique item. Based on the goal of the project, the GM will tell you the clock(s) to create and suggest a method by which you might make progress. To advance a long term project, make a **[project roll](/game/the-churn#project-rolls)** as normal.

#### Recover
When you recover, you seek treatment and heal your harm. You might visit a Bond or Contact who can help you, or you might rely on your own skills. Failing that, you bedrest and hope for the best. When you recover, make a **[project roll](/game/the-churn#project-rolls)** and mark a number of segments on the **healing clock** according to the result. When you fill your healing clock, reduce each instance of harm on your sheet by one level, then clear the clock. If you have more segments to mark, they "roll over".

Some harm can't be healed by normal means. Examples incude "hungry" and "tired". These can have their levels reduced by recovery, but require specific actions to heal engirely.

#### Relax
When you relax, you seek out comfort, peace, or vice. Whatever your character feels they need to reduce the stress of risking their lives on missions. When you relax, roll your lowest **attribute**. The result determines how much stress you clear.

If you would clear more stress than you have, it represents overindulgence or neglecting other parts of your life that need attention. Mark an amount of stress equal to the "roll over".

#### Shift Blame
When you shift blame, you're trying to reduce the crew's heat generated in missions. You might be spreading rumors, bribing officials, or framing someone else for your crimes. Whatever your approach, you need a scapegoat. Name them and make a **[project roll](/game/the-churn#project-rolls)**. The result determines how much heat you can reduce.

#### Train
When you spend time training, **mark 1 xp** on the xp track for an attribute or mission advancement. _You can only train a given xp track once per downtime._

<TypographyH2 id="project-rolls">
  Project Rolls
</TypographyH2>

During The Churn, there are many types of projects which the characters can undertake. Those projects are represented by a **clock** set by the rules or the GM. Before rolling for a project, the player decides the approach they want to take to pursue it. The GM then sets position and effect and the player rolls. The effect and roll together determines how much progress is made on the clock. Consequences of failure depend on the posistion as normal.
