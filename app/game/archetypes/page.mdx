# Archetypes

Trouble. Defiance. Rebellion. Danger and thrill at the prospect of making the overseers hurt, even if just a little. Victory at the cost of... well that's the question, isn't it? Who is your character when they aren't fighting the system? How do they treat their friends? What's their relationship with their family? Do they fight for the betterment of the community, or have they lost sight of the bigger picture?

Your character's Archetype is a reflection of their personality and the way they interact with friends, family, and the world around them. It grants unique character questions, actions, and abilities. The ability marked in gold is unlocked when you select the Archetype. Others can be taken as advancements.

_Sometimes when you dream, you make contact with someone else in a very real way. Who are they?_

_Who excites you? Makes you full of energy with just their presence? What's stopping you?_

_Which one of the overseers takes time to sabotage or outright ruin your clothing and appearance?_

_Your wide socialization has brought people together from many walks of life. What is this unlikely group of friends and what have you all accomplished which could only have been done together?_

_Who did you break up with because they criticized you and just killed the spark?_
