# Archetypes

Trouble. Defiance. Rebellion. Danger and thrill at the prospect of making the overseers hurt, even if just a little. Victory at the cost of... well that's the question, isn't it? Who is your character when they aren't fighting the system? How do they treat their friends? What's their relationship with their family? Do they fight for the betterment of the community, or have they lost sight of the bigger picture?

Your character's Archetype is a reflection of their personality and the way they interact with friends, family, and the world around them. It grants unique character questions, actions, and abilities. The ability marked in gold is unlocked when you select the Archetype. Others can be taken as advancements.

<span className="inline-block text-amber-700 font-bold">The Life of the Mind</span>: A cerebral sort often lost in day-dreams.
