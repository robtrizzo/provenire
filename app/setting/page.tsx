      <h1>Before anyone can remember</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Jolana Arbor</strong> woke up.
      </p>
      <p>She wandered fields resting thousands of slumberers.</p>
      <p>
        Until she saw <strong>it</strong>. A bright monolith, suspended above
        her kin.
      </p>
      <p>
        She reached out to <strong>it</strong>, frightened, but awed by{' '}
        <strong>it's</strong> beauty and warmth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>It</strong> filled her outstretched hand with{' '}
        <strong>water</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jolana</strong> had never known thirst, but a new instinct
        compelled her to drink.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jolana</strong> had never known danger, but new senses awoke her
        to impending calamity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jolana</strong> had never known war, but new power she used to
        hide away the slumberers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>She</strong> scattered them to the winds, trees, and sands in
        the corners of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        They somehow survived the battle <strong>she</strong> fought for them.
      </p>
      <p>And eventually one woke up.</p>
      <p>
        Her first sight was of <strong>Jolana</strong>, who was embracing her
        and laughing with joy. <strong>Jolana</strong> tearfully named her{' '}
        <strong>Anya</strong>, and daughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        As more awoke, <strong>Jolana</strong> begged their forgivness before
        whispering into <strong>Anya's</strong> ear and kissing her one last
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before <strong>Anya</strong> could speak a word to her mother,{' '}
        <strong>Jolana</strong> was swallowed by the heavens, never to be seen
        again.
      </p>
      <h2>Awakening</h2>
      <p>Those who awoke found themselves in a harsh and unforgiving world.</p>
      <p>
        Each person boldly spoke a language that only they could understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Water</strong> was nowhere to be found, people instead
        subsisting off of animal <strong>blood</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strange monoliths dot the varied lanscapes of the world, gigantic and
        enigmatic.
      </p>
      <h2>The First Donum</h2>
      <p>
        No one knows what <strong>Jolana</strong> said to <strong>Anya</strong>{' '}
        that morning, but in the aftermath of the <strong>Awakening</strong>,
        young <strong>Anya</strong> performed a miracle.
      </p>
      <p>
        High on the hills above her former resting place stood three of the
        strange monoliths. <strong>Anya</strong> stood between them, and
        commanded them to give her <strong>water</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The monoliths obeyed, and <strong>Anya</strong> drank. She then
        commanded them to give <strong>water</strong> to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The monoliths obeyed. <strong>Anya</strong> watched as water flowed from
        the monoliths, and into the rolling hills below.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <strong>Anya's</strong> language, she named her miracle{' '}
        <em>Donum Aquae</em> - the Gift of Water.
