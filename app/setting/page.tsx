      <h1>Before anyone can remember</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Jolana Arbor</strong> woke up.
      </p>
      <p>She wandered fields resting thousands of slumberers.</p>
      <p>
        Until she saw <strong>it</strong>. A bright monolith, suspended above
        her kin.
      </p>
      <p>
        She reached out to <strong>it</strong>, frightened, but awed by{" "}
        <strong>it's</strong> beauty and warmth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>It</strong> filled her outstretched hand with{" "}
        <strong>water</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jolana</strong> had never known thirst, but a new instinct
        compelled her to drink.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jolana</strong> had never known danger, but new senses awoke her
        to impending calamity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jolana</strong> had never known war, but new power she used to
        hide away the slumberers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>She</strong> scattered them to the winds, trees, and sands in
        the corners of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        They somehow survived the battle <strong>she</strong> fought for them.
      </p>
      <p>And eventually one woke up.</p>
      <p>
        Her first sight was of <strong>Jolana</strong>, who named her{" "}
        <strong>Anya</strong>, and daughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before <strong>Anya</strong> could speak a word to her mother,{" "}
        <strong>Jolana</strong> was swallowed by the heavens, never to be seen
        again.
      </p>
      <h2>Waking up</h2>
      <p>
        After <strong>Anya</strong>, many more people started stirring from
        sleep, but they found themselves in a harsh and unforgiving world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each person boldly spoke a language that only they could understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Water was nowhere to be found, people instead subsisting off of animal
        blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strange monoliths dot the varied lanscapes of the world, gigantic and
        enigmatic.
      </p>
