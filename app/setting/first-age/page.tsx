      <TypographyH1>The First Age</TypographyH1>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>Anya Arbor</strong> quickly became a god to the people of the
        rolling hills, though she was forever weakened by her miracle.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        They named themselves the <strong>Arborians</strong>, and adopted{' '}
        <strong>Anya&apos;s</strong> language.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        The <strong>Arborians</strong> settled the <strong>Three Gates</strong>{' '}
        and founded the city of <strong>Helix</strong>, named for the swirling
        canals constructed to capture and contain the water flowing from the
        monoliths.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyH2>Outside Arboria</TypographyH2>
      <TypographyP>
        The other awoken across the world were not so lucky as the{' '}
        <strong>Arborians</strong>
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        No deity to unite them or to unlock water from the monoliths, the
        scattered awoken toiled in their harsh wildernesses for an untold time
        before they came together in large enough numbers to share a common
        language or culture.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>The Cumerians</strong> found themselves in a dark and hostile
        forest and surrounded by ravenous predators.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>The Gredorans</strong> awoke on a grassy steppe to the heat on
        an impending lava flow.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>The Rathi</strong> were abandoned to survive in a dense and
        unforgiving jungle.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>The Narscillians</strong> were stirred from sleep by shifting
        sands and a parching sun.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>The Torans</strong> began to wander expansive grasslands and
        sheer mountains.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>The Kilder</strong> woke to immediate struggle - not to be
        consumed by the hungry marsh.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        Word spread of a bountiful place in the south where{' '}
        <strong>water</strong> flowed freely and predators were sparse. A great
        migration to <strong>Arboria</strong> took place over the next years.
        But when the travellers arived, they found walls blocking them from
        heaven.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyH2>Migrant War // Slaughter of the Foothills</TypographyH2>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>The Arborians</strong> decided to keep <strong>Helix</strong>{' '}
        and all of its <strong>water</strong> to themselves, viewing themselves
        as the rightful heirs to the city as <strong>Jolana&apos;s</strong>{' '}
        kinsmen. The migrants were forced to decide wether to fight, or to go
        back to their harsh homelands. Bloody war ensued.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        Despite the advantage of numbers and desperation, the throngs of awoken
        were no match for the weilders of <Donum>Donum Aquae</Donum>,{' '}
        <Donum>Donum Silex</Donum>, and <Donum>Donum Silva</Donum>. The
        Arborians had been drinking from the monoliths for years, and had been
        granted the strength of that <strong>water</strong>.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        After a single crushing battle, the <strong>Arborians</strong> drove
        back the migrants to their homelands, fated to toil and dwindle away.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyH2>Anya&apos;s Labors // The Accord War</TypographyH2>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>Anya Arbor</strong> could not sit idly by and watch the genocide
        of six peoples. Despite her influence over the people of{' '}
        <strong>Arboria</strong>, she was unable to reach them through their
        twisted lust for dominance. <strong>Anya</strong> and her allies stole
        away from <strong>Helix</strong> in the night.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>Anya</strong> traveled to the lands of each people, teaching
        them how to open the monoliths, which she coined{' '}
        <strong>Life Ducts</strong>. She was no longer strong enough to open any{' '}
        <strong>Life Ducts</strong> permanently. She could barely manage to keep
        each open for more than a few moments, and her health became worse with
        each.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        As the peoples of each nation drank, they began to develop{' '}
        <em>Donums</em> as well. Each was radically different from the last,{' '}
        <strong>Anya</strong> naming them all.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        The only exception was <strong>Kilder</strong>. The farthest away from{' '}
        <strong>Arboria</strong> and the most difficult to travel,{' '}
        <strong>Anya</strong> and her companions were unable to navigate to the{' '}
        <strong>Life Ducts</strong> there.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>Anya</strong> retuned to <strong>Helix</strong> with an army of
        six nations behind her, all but the <strong>Kilder</strong> with{' '}
        <em>Donums</em>.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        The <strong>Helix Accords</strong> were signed the following day, making{' '}
        <strong>Helix</strong> a city of six nations and a democratically
        elected council.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyH2>Anya&apos;s Death // Death of the Accords</TypographyH2>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>Anya</strong> didn&apos;t live long after the{' '}
        <strong>Helix Accords</strong> were signed. With the six foreign armies
        disbanded, the leaders in <strong>Helix</strong> raised an army and
        overwhelmed everyone who had stayed behind, driving them from{' '}
        <strong>Helix</strong> once again. The weilders of{' '}
        <Donum>Donum Silex</Donum> spent the coming years constructing walls so
        enormous that no army, <em>Donums</em> or not, could breach them.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        Where the <strong>Helix Accords</strong> technically still stood,
        foreigners were not welcome and the democracy in the city became
        corrupt.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyH2>Era of War</TypographyH2>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>Helix</strong> was left to its own devices for an unknown number
        of years. With the advent of <em>Donums</em> outside of{' '}
        <strong>Arboria</strong>, survival wasn&apos;t as bleak as it had been
        before, with the exception of <strong>Kilder</strong>.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        But <strong>water</strong> wasn&apos;t the only rare resource in the
        world. Sturdy wood, sculptable stone, workable metal, medicinal herbs,
        harvestable nuts and berries, less formiddable game - all heavily
        contested by neighboring peoples. The cultures which were briefly united
        to march on <strong>Helix</strong> couldn&apos;t be called anything
        resembling nations. Despite sharing languages and common customs, the
        peoples of each region stuck to their own, and competed for resources.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        Outside of <strong>Helix</strong>, the huntable game is incredibly
        deadly. Being a hunter is synonymous with being a talented fighter.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        With so many warriors, conflicts among peoples lead to bloodly wars
        which surrender or peace is a bitterly slow result.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        Chief amongst tribes in terms of military might was{' '}
        <strong>Kilder</strong>. Despite not having <em>Donums</em>, their
        warriors are trained from an exceptionally young age and their
        warleaders would historically outwit their opponents.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyH2>Ghodbane&apos;s Campaign</TypographyH2>
      <TypographyP>
        The birth of <strong>Hamdi Ghodbane</strong> heralded the end of the{' '}
        <strong>Era of War</strong>. As a <strong>Kilder</strong> child,{' '}
        <strong>Ghodbane</strong> was the first recipeint of{' '}
        <Donum>Donum Duellum</Donum> - <em>The Gift of War</em>.{' '}
        <strong>Ghodbane</strong> became leader of his caravan at age eight, the
        commander of his warband at age ten, and by age twelve had been named{' '}
        <strong>King Ghodbane</strong>.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>Ghodbane</strong> lead a brutal and efficient campaign; the line
        between <Donum>Donum Duellum</Donum> and his tactical genius was
        indistinguishable. Within a matter of months, the{' '}
        <strong>Kilder</strong> had conquered most of <strong>Rath</strong> and{' '}
        <strong>Gredora</strong> with minimal casualties on all sides.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        With three armies under his banner, <strong>Ghodbane</strong> declared
        that it was time for <strong>Helix</strong> to begin honoring the{' '}
        <strong>Accords</strong> it had sworn to ages ago.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        At the foot of <strong>Helix&apos;s</strong> insurmountable walls,{' '}
        <strong>Ghodbane</strong> initiated negotiations. The{' '}
        <strong>Imperator</strong> of <strong>Helix</strong>,{' '}
        <strong>Fleur Mercator</strong> met with him.{' '}
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>Ghodbane&apos;s</strong> demands were not surrender or material.
        The first demand was to found a peacekeeping force based in{' '}
        <strong>Helix</strong> in which any nation&apos;s warriors could join,
        should they prove themselves strong enough. The second demand was to
        reinstate the <strong>Helix Accords</strong> with an amendment to the
        election process. No longer would leaders be chosen with the corrupted
        democracy that had festered in <strong>Helix</strong>. Instead,{' '}
        <strong>Helix&apos;s</strong> council would be elected in trial by
        combat, hosted once every fifty years.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>Fleur Mercator</strong> discussed this with the other members of{' '}
        <strong>Helix&apos;s</strong> council. They found these demands
        barbaric, disastrous, and unacceptable.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        Much to the council&apos;s dismay, and then rage, <strong>Fleur</strong>{' '}
        ignored their council and agreed to <strong>Ghodbane&apos;s</strong>{' '}
        demands.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>Ghodbane</strong> released the <strong>Rathi</strong> and{' '}
        <strong>Gredorans</strong> from his service, keeping a small contingent
        of his strongest warriors to help <strong>Fleur</strong> maintain peace
        until the first election by combat could be held.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        With the army gone, civil war erupted in <strong>Helix</strong>. The{' '}
        <strong>Mercator</strong> family, weilders of <Donum>Donum Silva</Donum>{' '}
        remained loyal to <strong>Fleur</strong>. <strong>The Arbors</strong> of{' '}
        <Donum>Donum Aquae</Donum> and <strong>The Santoris</strong> of{' '}
        <Donum>Donum Silex</Donum> fought for their traditions in turn.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        With the assistance of <strong>Ghodbane</strong>, <strong>Fleur</strong>{' '}
        and the <strong>Mercators</strong> won the war, but victory was pyrrhic.
        As a result of the devastating conflict, <Donum>Donum Silva</Donum> has
        dwindled into history.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyH2>Present Day</TypographyH2>
      <TypographyP>
        <strong>Helix</strong> still stands, as do the{' '}
        <strong>Helix Accords</strong>. Where <strong>Helix</strong> is still
        within <strong>Arborian</strong> territory, it&apos;s ruled by a council
        of representatives from all the nations. The council is responsible for
        overseeing the city and selecting the <strong>Imperator</strong>: the
        ruler of <strong>Helix</strong>.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        Thanks to <strong>Anya Arbor&apos;s</strong> sacrifices, <em>Donums</em>{' '}
        have spread to each region with the exception of <strong>Kilder</strong>
        . Around one in one thousand people recieve <em>Donums</em>. The variety
        of the powers differentiate between regions, communities, families, and
        the individual; however, differences become smaller and smaller as
        wielders are closer in blood.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        Absent <strong>Anya&apos;s</strong> mythical power, each people has been
        left to learn the secrets of each <strong>Life Duct</strong>. The
        communites that survive are the ones which have learned to activate the{' '}
        <strong>Life Ducts</strong>, albeit for short periods of time. The
        techniques seem to vary for each <strong>Life Duct</strong>.
