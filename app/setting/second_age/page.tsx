      <h1>New Beginning</h1>
      <blockquote>
        An age ago, the world was shattered and remade, or so the legends go.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The Gods themselves walked upon our soil. Our greatest warriors had
        fallen, or had joined the enemy. The world was ending. Humanity was at
        its bitter end.
      </p>
      <p>
        What happened next, no one can remember. Not the scholars, the
        historians, the world travellers, no records, no memory remains of the
        time between the <strong>Old Gods</strong> and the <strong>New</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first recollection of the <strong>Second Age</strong> was the{' '}
        <strong>Great Dream</strong>. A dream that all of humanity shared. The
        seven <strong>New Gods</strong> appeared before us, declaring that they
        were renouncing their power, taking their leave. But they siad not to
        despair, for the power will not truly be gone - it will be here for
        those worthy enough to take it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <h3>Final Words of the Great Dream</h3>
        <p>
          The greatest trials of humanity are yet to come. And when they do, we
          eagerly await the new heroes who will overcome them.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
      <p>
        All that's left of that time is legend, myth, and heresay. Centuries
        have come and gone since those fateful years, but much has changed from
        how it once was.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>New Gods</strong> taught the people of the world how to open
        the <strong>Life Ducts</strong>. And from that water, many new{' '}
        <em>Donums</em> were born. Thousands of families with no history of
        power began to have children with incredible new abilities that shook
        the structure of societies. By the time the <strong>New Gods</strong>{' '}
        had faded into myth, it was more common to have a <em>Donum</em> than
        not.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as it always seems to go, the people with power began to take power.
        Migrations, treaties, wars, nations did everything within their power to
        seize as many <strong>ducts</strong> as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the power of all <em>Donums</em> were not what they used to be.
        The legendary abilities of the heroes of the past slowly rose out of
        reach, leaving those withour power to sieze a larger role than they ever
        had a chance to. But without that great power of the past, surviving in
        the wild became even harder than it had ever been.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <em>Ascending</em>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Rather than helping their peoples, many of the greatest warriors and
        hunters of all cultures instead became one of the <em>Ascending</em>:
        one who preoccupies their time with the{' '}
        <strong>Trials of Godhood</strong>, a series of great feats, challenges,
        and combats fabled to earn that power the <strong>New Gods</strong> had
        referenced in the <strong>Great Dream</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this, tribes, caravans, nations had to offer opulent rewards
        to attract the attention of <em>Ascending</em>, and not necessarily ones
        from their own cultures. Nations now competed for the attention of the{' '}
        <em>Ascending</em>, and the <em>Ascending</em> competed for the rewards
        of the nations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, being an <em>Ascended</em> means less of an obsession with
        godhood and more about attracting wealthy employers.{' '}
        <strong>The Trials of Godhood</strong> are now just a way to vie for
        higher rank and pay.
