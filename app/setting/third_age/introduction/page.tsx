      <h1>Campaign Introduction</h1>
      <blockquote>
        It begins with a factory full of workers pushed to their breaking point.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The factory, unlovingly named <strong>The Steel Trap</strong> by its
        workers, produces munitions for the <strong>Royal Rathi Army</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its workers labor among a dangerous matrix of twisted, screeching
        machinery; breathe in foulness that leaves them dizzy for days; and must
        withstand horrible abuses from their higher-ups. Towering above the
        workforce is <strong>Lawler</strong>, their fearsome foreman, and the
        Royal Guards and hired beasts he's got watching the place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Punishing and brutal work only punctuated by the sleeping hours.
        Something has changed, though. An <strong>Imperial Legate</strong> met
        with <strong>Lawler</strong> last week, and some whisper about a secret
        shipment brought into <strong>The Steel Trap</strong> in the dead of
        night. Shifts are longer, the equipment different, and{' '}
        <strong>Lawler</strong> more ruthless.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sten</strong>, an eight-year-old steel scrapper, was recently
        killed by one of the new machines. His older sister{' '}
        <strong>Quill</strong>, also a worker at the factory, could recover no
        more than his severed head after the accident. In compensation for the
        death of her brother, <strong>Lawler</strong> has given her a single day
        off for the burial.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is quiet, simmering outrage among the workers. This isn't the
        first time something horrible has happened, many hope it's the last, but
        no one is sure what to do. If anything. <em>'If Anything'</em> is the
        thought stuck in your crew's head. You endure the indignities at{' '}
        <strong>The Steel Trap</strong> day in and day out.{' '}
        <em>If Anything, something must be done.</em>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Small acts of rebellion matter.</blockquote>
      <h2>Themes</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Campaign: Era 3</strong> takes place in the same world as the
        other eras, but an unknown time in the future. Where this campaign will
        be narrative Dark Fantasy // Drama // Intrigue, the main focus will
        always be on the characters and their experiences.
      </p>
      <h2>Rath</h2>
      <p>
        The world of bygone eras, its lands, peoples, history: it's all gone.
        Cycle after cycle, slowly devoured by the ever-ravenous Rathi Empire and
        its God King. Rath is all that is left, save for a desperate few who
        struggle for survival in the world's fringes...{' '}
        <em>or so they say within the King's reaches</em>.
      </p>
      <h3>Kingwulf</h3>
      <p>
        Immortal God-King of the <strong>Rathi Empire</strong>. They{' '}
        <em>say</em> he has been King since the day the world came to be: born
        into the role. They <em>say</em> he gifted the sun, the wind, the soil,
        fire, and most importantly, <Blood /> to all. They <em>say</em> he takes
        the form of a massive wolf, the like of which causes earth to tremble
        and his bloodline to fall in worship. They <em>say</em> that it is by
        his eternal love that the world strives on day after day. They{' '}
        <em>say</em> that one day, he will bless the world one final time by
        devouring it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But no one has seen him in nearly fifty years. Since the day he sealed
        himself in his audience hall, not a sound can be heard from within. What
        has become of him? What will become of <em>us</em> in his absence?
      </p>
      <h3>The Steel Trap</h3>
      <p>
        Our story begins in <strong>Vizgod</strong>, a territory of the{' '}
        <strong>Rathi Empire</strong> characterized by a forest of massive pines
        stretching a mile high or more. Oversized and deadly predators roam
        these wildlands. In <strong>Vizgod</strong> are a few cities, but our
        story takes place in <strong>Liberty City</strong>, a sprawling
        industrial affair. Some compare it to a prison more than a city, since
        fleeing into the <strong>Titan Pines</strong> is almost certain death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within <strong>Liberty City</strong> there are those <em>with</em> and
        those <em>without</em>. Our protagonists are the unlucky ones. They live
        in <strong>The Kennels</strong>: half shanty town half factory district.
        Thick smoke chokes the streets, King's Guards prowl and devour anyone
        out of line, and the Overseers maintain their vice grip on the food
        supply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyday life goes on though. The people of <strong>The Kennels</strong>{' '}
        toil and push on, families, friends, communities come together to make
        life more bearable for each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of those communities is the workers of the{' '}
        <strong>Steel Trap</strong>: a munitions factory for the{' '}
        <strong>Royal Rathi Army</strong>. A truly miserable and hopeless place.
        Still, the workers quietly, obediently, dream of a better future. That's
        where our protagonists come in.
