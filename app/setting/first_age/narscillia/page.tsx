      <h2>Celebrate Light, Life</h2>
      <p>
        Anyone nearby can hear the sounds of boisterous music and mischivious
        laughter far before a <strong>Narscillian</strong> <em>compagnia's</em>{' '}
        shadowy globe comes into view. Flutes, drums, and light hearted voiced
        boom wherever a <em>compagnia</em> goes. These sounds are greeted with
        smiles and welcome by any <strong>Toran</strong>,{' '}
        <strong>Arborian</strong>, or <strong>Cumerian</strong> close enough to
        the border to take temporary part in the daily celebrations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Narscillians</strong> are always more than happy to have
        guests, welcoming all who wish to join and travel with them as long as
        they wish. The <em>compagnia</em> never stops moving though, so the
        occasional inebriated guest finds themselves waking up many miles from
        home.
      </p>
      <p>
        These celebrations entail dancing, drinking, games of contest, and the
        music <strong>Narscillians</strong> are famous for. All of which is
        under a dome of shadow, shielding those underneath from the harsh rays
        of the desert sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        And as the night draws near, the dome of shadow is replaced by the warm
        glow of <strong>Narscillian</strong> <Donum>Donum Lux</Donum> lighting
        the way of the perpetual march.
      </p>
      <h2>Song of the Hunt</h2>
      <p>
        To most, <strong>Narscillian</strong> music sounds chaotic and
        uproarious, but one with the trained ear can tell the antics of the{' '}
        <em>compagnia</em> simply by listening. Many of the creatures of the
        desert are fearsome to those untrained in their ways. But the{' '}
        <strong>Narscillians</strong> know that these predators have poor
        eyesight and hunt by msound alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when <strong>Narscillian</strong> hunters trail off the{' '}
        <em>compagnia</em>, the music will change to overwhelm the senses of
        mosnters: higher pitched for some, lower for others. With the music
        drowning out the sound of the hunters, they make short work of their
        quarry and bring back a feast for their compatriots.
      </p>
      <p>
        These creatures have excellent camoflage howeverm especially from those
        travelling on foot. So the <strong>Narscillians</strong> have
        camel-pulled wagons with crow's nests attached. Lookouts scour the sand
        dunes from these vantage points for potential threats, signlalling
        danger and direction with a unique flute, blending their alert perfectly
        into the song of the <em>compagnia</em> of course.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <em>Mantello Dovere</em>
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
        Ours is the measure which has no limit, the task which has no end.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        So goes the mantra of the <em>Relicts</em>, those few burdened with the
        weight of all <strong>Narscillia</strong>. The <em>Relicts</em> bear the{' '}
        <em>Mantello Dovere</em>, or the Mantra of Duty. Every five years, the
        children under the age of five are entered into a lottery. One child is
        selected to bear the <em>Mantle</em>, and given a red cape to symbolize
        their life's duty.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>compagnias</em> have always been effective at gathering food and
        fighting the foes of the outer desert. But as{' '}
        <strong>Anya Arbor</strong> showed the <strong>Narscillians</strong>, it
        requires significant offering to open a <strong>Life Duct</strong>. The
        kind of offering that can only be found by those who press deeper into
        the desert. A rare blue flower grows around strange crystals scattered
        throughout the desert. These flowers are the only way to open the{' '}
        <strong>Life Ducts</strong> in <strong>Narscillia</strong>.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>That tone, the one that sound skind of sad, what is that one for?</p>
        <p>A red cape on the horizon.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Not only is it too dangerous for the <em>compagnias</em> to venture into
        the inner desert, the time it would take them to find a crystal, find
        their way out, and travel toa <strong>Life Duct</strong> in the outer
        desert would be far too great. So a radical course was taken: a select
        few would roam the inner desert, collecting flowers and bringing them to
        the <strong>Life Ducts</strong> so that fresh water would be available
        whenever a <em>compangia</em> arrived.
      </p>

          <p>
            The <em>Manello Dovere</em> does not only apply to keeping the{' '}
            <em>compagnias</em> supplied, but to protecting them as well.{' '}
            <em>Relicts</em> are the front line defense against creatures of the
            inner desert who find their way to the rim. And when the{' '}
            <strong>Narscillians</strong> declare war, the <em>Relicts</em> are
            their elite agents, doing what must be done, <em>whatever</em> must
            be done to protect their people.
          </p>
          <p>
            To bear the <em>Mantle</em> means to lead a solitary life. If a{' '}
            <em>Relict</em> is lucky, they may meet another of their order in
            their travels, but mostly they wander alone, facing the desert for
            the good of their kinsmen. Suffering so that others don't need to.
            For a <em>Relict</em>, death would truly be a release from their
            cruel life, but none have ever relented, for if they do, they know
            it means the deaths of their people.

        Regardless of a <em>Relict</em> possessing <em>Donum</em> or not, they

        in the <strong>Academia Arcadia</strong>, which no <em>Relict</em> has
        ever failed to gain entry to.
      </p>
      <p>
        After their studies in <strong>Helix</strong>, <em>Relicts</em> become
        apprentices for three years before setting off into the inner desert on
        their own.
