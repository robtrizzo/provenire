        When you imagined the ancient power of the Arborians, how did you think
        it would make you feel? Brimming with potential? Companionship with your
        forebears? Whatever your preconceptions or fantasies, there is nothing
        which could have prepared you for this.

      <TypographyP>
        You sense something new outside of yourself. You are standing over it;
        and it is frighteningly large. So large, that you feel your head spin in
        the pursuit of comprehending its largeness. Your mind slackens and the
        scope of this perception accellerates; you quickly find your smallness
        has vanished within a fraction of the immensity.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        When you come back to yourself, you know with certainty that this
        immensity is yours to shape. In ages past perhaps you would have had
        instructors versed in nurturing this ability in you. But for you, this
        will be a personal journey.
