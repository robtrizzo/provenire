        Of all <b>Donum Silex&apos;s</b> aspects, the Santorises prized molding
        and sculpting above all else. Their gift is not a device for war; it is
        an art form. A gift to them, and from them to the world.

        You may spend <b className="text-blue-500">1 Water</b> to sculpt
        existing stone or earth into the shape you desire. All stone touched by{" "}
        <b>Donum Silex</b> desires a fractal helix shape. Guiding it into
        something else is a difficult task. Stronger and more brittle substances
        are more difficult to shape.
