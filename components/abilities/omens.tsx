        Seeing forward to your own doom can have its advantages. Sometimes you
        remember events and places you&apos;ll be. It comes to you in dreams and
        hallucinations, troubling you but allowing you a degree of foresight.
        Once per <b>downtime</b>, you may mark <b>2 stress</b> to receive an
        omen.
