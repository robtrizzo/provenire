        <b>Felicity</b> and her of media coordinators are in the team&apos;s ear
        to make sure <span className="font-cyber">Cytech</span> captures all the
        best footage. But they&apos;ve never been in your shoes. You see the
        action first-hand and you know for a fact that you&apos;re a better
        director than they are a lot of the time.

        When you disagree with <b>Felicity</b> on a directing call,{" "}
        <b>push yourself</b> and make an <b>action roll</b>. <b>1-5</b>: if it
        goes wrong, it&apos;s on you, <b>mark 2 stress</b>; <b>4-6</b>: you can
        reframe the action scene in the way you want; <b>Crit</b>: it&apos;s
        fucking fire, both you and the filmed operative get a bonus 1 Â¤P.
