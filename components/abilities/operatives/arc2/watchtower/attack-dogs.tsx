        Turns out the <span className="font-cyber">&quot;Watchdogs&quot;</span>{" "}
        had less of their starting tech stripped out than you thought. It&apos;s
        disabled, but nothing a skilled{" "}
        <span className="font-cyber">Watchtower</span> can&apos;t undo. Once
        reactivated, attacking with them is as easy as mentally indicating a
        target. They take care of the rest.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        Keep in mind that <b>Felicity</b> won&apos;t approve. So be subtle. And
        for fuck&apos;s sake, don&apos;t get all the drones taken out in some
        frivolous combat.
