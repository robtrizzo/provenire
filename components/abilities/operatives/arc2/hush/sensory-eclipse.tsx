        it&apos;s like the cyberware is measuring you, testing to see if
        you&apos;re worthy. Once it judged you are, the final controls revealed
        themselves to you.

        Within the vapor, there are no senses. Without your thoughts, you
        wouldn&apos;t even know you&apos;re alive.
