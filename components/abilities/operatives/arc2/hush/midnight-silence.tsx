        Yet more contols hidden in the recesses of your body. You don&apos;t
        remember the chrome being instlled there, but there&apos;s an appealing
        subtlety to it nonetheless.

      <TypographyP>
        With these new controls, <span className="font-cyber">Hush</span> can
        enhance the vapor to dampen sounds in addition to swallowing light.
        It&apos;s an oppressive silence in which you can&apos;t even hear your
        own heartbeat.
