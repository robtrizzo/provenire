        Once <span className="font-cyber">Canons</span> get familiar with the

        <span className="font-cyber">Close</span>). <i>But</i>, if{" "}
        <span className="font-cyber">Canon</span> chooses to do it of their own
        volition you bet <span className="font-cyber">Root</span> has the
        cameras ready.

        If <span className="font-cyber">Canon</span> wants to do this, they need
        to supply a second fuel-cell&apos;s worth of power to the weapon. The
        shot they fire off is an overwhelming blast wave of pure fucking cinema.
        Then <span className="font-cyber">Canon</span> chooses four of the
