        Sometimes damage to your sleeve may happen unexpectedly or faster than
        you can think. For cases like this, skilled users of{" "}
        <span className="font-cyber">&quot;Revivify&quot;</span> can flush their
        body with the healing energies a short time before expected catastrophe
        to increase their odds of survival.

      <TypographyP>
        When you activate{" "}
        <span className="font-cyber">&quot;Revivify&quot;</span> in this way,
        some energy is inevitably wasted. <b>Push yourself</b> and reduce the
        next <b>harm</b> you receive in a short timeframe by <b>3 tiers</b>.
