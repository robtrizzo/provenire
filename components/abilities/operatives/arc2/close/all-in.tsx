      <TypographyP>
        The mind places mental blocks on pushing your body past its limits. This
        is for good reason so that you dont&apos;t injure yourself. But with
        chrome like the <span className="font-cyber">&quot;Revivify&quot;</span>
        , that sort of thinking is obselete for you.
      </TypographyP>
      <TypographyP>
        There&apos;s no special trick to using the{" "}
        <span className="font-cyber">&quot;Revivify&quot;</span> in this way.
        You brace yourself and bush far beyond your phsyical limits, dealing
        with the pain because you know it&apos;s just pain. <b>Push yourself</b>{" "}
        to perform a burst of superhuman strength or stamina.
      </TypographyP>
