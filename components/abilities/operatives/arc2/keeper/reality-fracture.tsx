        Sometimes you feel resistance when pulling out of a simulation, a form
        of inertia which would suggest it&apos;s somewhere you could stay. Or
        even return. When catastrophe strikes the team,{" "}
        <span className="font-cyber">Keeper</span> may mark a <b>condition</b>.
        If they do, they find themselves back in time: just before the worst
        happened.

      <div className="my-2">

      </div>
      <TypographyP>Then something else strange happens.</TypographyP>
