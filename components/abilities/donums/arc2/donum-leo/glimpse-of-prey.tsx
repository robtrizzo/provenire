      Catching sight of something running in the dark is thrilling. It&apos;s
      like catching a whiff of warm bread on an empty stomach. You can follow
      quickly moving targets in near-total darkness as easily as you could trail
      someone having a conversation. But if you wish to stop stalking your
      quarry, you must <b>resist</b> your instincts.
