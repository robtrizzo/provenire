        You can feel it. The power spiderwebbing through your interior. Pressing
        into every extremity. Clawing against the edges of your body like hound
        trapped in too small a cage. The power&apos;s desperate potential fuels
        you, animates your body, and activates your senses.

        &quot;It was quite precious to them. The Argosi. They built their lives,
        their city, their very culture around it. And if I&apos;m allowed to
        speculate, I would guess it was their god, too.&quot; - Doctor Kantor

        As your senses expand, you become aware of Feasting City&apos;s rain.
        Every single drop. It&apos;s not a noise or a smell. It&apos;s the
        feeling of someone staring at the back of your head, but kaleidoscoped
        in a million directions. The power draws you and the rain closer
        together. It feels as if it wants to funnel the contents of the very sky
        through you.

        &quot;We thought all the Argosi Donums were lost to war. Even a single
        one could change the course of the rebellion.&quot; - Handler Glory

        You know what others want from <b>Donum Aquae</b>. You have a vague
        impression of what the power wants with you. But what can you actually
        wield this power to do?
