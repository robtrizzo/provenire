        Catching the scent of prey and predator is thrilling and chilling.
        Smells are like overhearing conversations in a crowded hall: obvious,
        though their direction and details are muddy. You always know if someone
        vulnerable to you is about to flee and you always know when someone
        you&apos;re vulnerable to is about to pounce.
      </TypographyP>
