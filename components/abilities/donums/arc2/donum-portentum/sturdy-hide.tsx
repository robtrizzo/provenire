        Cornered prey and desperate predator alike can lash out in one last
        gambit to hurt their foe. You are immune to injury from small or weakly
        swung weapons. When you transform or extend your transformation, treat
        yourself as wearing <b>Armor</b>, though it does not cost any slots to
        carry.
