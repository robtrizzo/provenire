        Hardened quills leave a buzzard&apos;s body still vulnerable to piercing
        talons and fangs. But unlike the wolf&apos;s ability to thicken its
        hide, steeled quills armor avians against large weapons. You are immune
        to injury from large slashing attacks unless the force of impact is
        substantial. Spend <b className="text-red-500">1 Blood</b> to reduce an
        incoming <b>harm</b> by 2 steps.
