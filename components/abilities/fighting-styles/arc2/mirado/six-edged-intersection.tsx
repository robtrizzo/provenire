        Mirado is an ancient Hiean word, which roughly translates into &quot;the
        art of six edges&quot;. The combat awareness aspects of the martial art
        is new, but the striking style has retained its roots. When up close and
        personal with a foe, large weapons and movements become ineffective
        against you.
