        Catching the smell of someone you&apos;re looking for is thrilling.
        It&apos;s like seeing a distant light in a dark passage. You can follow
        scents as naturally as you could trail someone having a conversation.
        But if you wish to stop following the scent, you must <b>resist</b> your
        instincts.
