        The <i>largeness</i> was overwhelming to behold at first, but now that
        you&apos;re more familiar with its presence, your senses are free to
        detect closer, smaller things. You always know which direction is down.
        You always know if something is made from stone or earth, in part or in
        full. You may spend <b className="text-blue-500">1 Water</b> to detect
        particularly strong and weak points in stone.
